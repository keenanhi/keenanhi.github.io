Mastering is the final part of the three part process through which digital music is created. The process goes something like this:

Recording: This is the stage in which different parts of a song are captured and collected into a computer.
Mixing: This is the stage in which those different parts are tweaked, touched up, and collected into one song.
Mastering: This is the stage in which the song is made ready for commercial release

To understand what mastering is, we must first understand what recording and mixing are. Let’s learn:

Recording

During the recording stage, real live sound is captured and stored somewhere, these days typically on a computer’s hard drive. The sound is captured with the help of devices called transducers, which convert energy from one form to another. For example, an engine of a car, which turns the chemical energy stored in gasoline to the kinetic energy of the vehicle, is a transducer. Where recording is concerned, we are dealing primarily with one type of transducer: Electroacoustic transducers. These transducers, as the name suggests, convert energy between the electric and acoustic domain. To recreate live music, we need to both be able to convert sound to electrical signals, and, inversely, convert electrical signals to sound.

To convert sound to electrical signals, we need a certain type of electroacoustic transducer. One of the most common of these, and one which you probably have heard of, is called a microphone. A microphone works by converting variations of air pressure (i.e. sound) to electrical energy (there are a few different ways microphones do this, though this is outside of the scope of this series, for the sake of brevity). Another example of an electroacoustic transducer that converts sound to electrical signals is an electric guitar pickup.

To convert electrical signals back to sound, we use a device called a loudspeaker. This has less to do with recording - except perhaps in the instance of electric guitar amplifiers - and more to do with mastering, so we will come back to these later.

Since this is a mini-series on mastering, and not recording, we won’t go more in-depth than this. Just know that in the recording stage, all the individual parts that make up a song are collected, and stored digitally on a computer.

Mixing

So now that all our parts are recorded, we need to arrange them in a way that sounds pleasing. Imagine, for instance, you record a song with drums, guitar, and vocals. If the guitar track is ten times louder than that of the drums or vocals, you most likely won’t be able to hear anything but the guitar (a particular scenario in which every live mix engineer has surely been). Mixing, in it’s simplest sense, is the process of creating a hierarchy of recorded tracks. Which tracks should be loudest, which should be barely audible? Which tracks should be the center of attention, which should show a supporting role? Which tracks should seem closest to the listener, which should seem furthest away?

Mixing may seem simple from this description, but it is often extremely complex, especially when you take into account that many popular songs contain a track count that approaches triple digits! 

There are a 




which pick up vibrations in the air (what we perceive as sound) and turn them into electric signals. 





here is a lot of jargon surrounding the creation of a song, especially in the age of digital music. For this reason, I have compiled a glossary of terms, to which I will link throughout this mini-series and my usual posts.

Even before we get to learning our vocab though, we need to understand the general process through which digital music is created. Just as a doctor must know everything about the reproductive process to deliver a baby, we must know how music is created all the way back to it’s conception.

Modern professional music, in every instance, is created following the four steps below:

The soul: songwriting

This is the song’s conception. At this stage, a huge collection of notes, rhythms, and maybe even lyrics come together and become a song. Now stay with me as I get a little spiritual: this is your song’s soul. You heard me. Without a soul, without the humanity that makes a song a song, it is just a bunch of sound. Remember that.

The DNA: Recording

This is the foundation of the song in its digital form. Each part of a song, each instrument in a song, is recorded to create unique code, a collection of bits that represent the song. Recording involves using a device called a transducer to capture the sound waves coming from different live instruments, such as guitar, drums, or voice, or, similarly, capturing digital audio signals coming from software instruments, such as synthesizers, drum machines, and turntables. Imagine this as, you guessed it, the DNA of the song: it is the coding working behind the song’s soul.

The Environment: Mixing 

This is the cultivation of a song’s digital form. Each separate instrument or part recording is combined, trimmed, and adjusted to 

Imagine this as a baby growing inside a womb. Though it’s growing and is being influenced by its mother’s nutrition and actions, either in a positive or negative way, the essence of the song is already there.

The Delivery: Mastering: 

This is the delivery of a song’s final digital form. Mastering involves adjusting the ENTIRE SONG as one product (this is important: mastering only deals with the entire, finished track as one entity. Things like vocals and guitar are no longer separate). The track is adjusted to meet typical standards, such as loudness, tone, and stereo width, and is pushed into a format of digital audio that will work on digital music devices such as your smartphone, or computer. Imagine this is the baby being delivered by a doctor: everything is already there, the doctor just has to bring the baby out into the world.

Though I am sure any midwife will tell you: easier said than done!

Mastering often involves just touching up little, tiny things; the difficulty comes in knowing WHAT to touch up. And that involves a lot of listening!

But before we get there and start mastering our own music, we need to know how to alter these sounds. If we are a doctor, we are nothing without tools! There are indeed many tools to touch up tracks during mastering, which you can read about in Part Two of the Get Started series.
