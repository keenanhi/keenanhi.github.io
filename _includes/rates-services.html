    Do you want your mastering engineer with you every step of the way? Mix Feedback gives you access to your mastering engineer when you want help with a mix that isn't quite sounding as great as you'd like.
    <br>
    <br>
    Mix Feedback goes a little something like this: you send us a mix, and we send you exactly what we would do to fix any issues you might be unhappy with. For example, if your vocal compression seems a little off, we can suggest control values on a specific compressor plug-in you might be using. Your mastering engineer will also tailor this advice to your skill level, so don't worry about feeling patronized (or jargon-ized).
    <br>
    <br>
     In addition to your monthly Mix Feedbacks, we give our members complimentary Mix Feedback for anything you have your engineer master. Examples of mix feedback are coming to our website soon.
