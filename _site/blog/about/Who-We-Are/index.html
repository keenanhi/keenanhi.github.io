<h3 id="keenan-hye---founder-and-mastering-engineer">Keenan Hye - Founder and Mastering Engineer</h3>

<p>I am originally from Madison, Connecticut, and I have been producing music since I was in early high school. I recently earned a degree in Electrical Engineering and Music Recording, and am planning on pursuing a graduate degree in Acoustical Engineering.</p>

<p>During the past five years, I have had experience researching human perception of audio quality, creating automated room equalization algorithms, and engineering directional hearing devices to aid people with hearing loss. All of this experience has given me a vast and varied understanding of topics important to mastering and our perception of music, including psychoacoustics, room acoustics, and digital audio processing.</p>

<p>To satiate my right brain, I spend most of my down time writing original music and lyrics, and, of course, recording and mixing my own music as well. I grew up playing saxophone, but now I’m primarily a singer and guitarist. Despite these preferences, I truly enjoy learning and understanding any instrument I can get my hands on!</p>

<p>The rest of the little free time I have left goes to coding and designing this website, as well as listening to podcasts (especially well-produced podcasts, such as <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">Radiolab</a> and <a href="http://songexploder.net/">Song Exploder</a>).</p>

<p>Helping people make great audio is absolutely my passion, and to me there is no substitute for the human touch that a real mastering engineer can add. I take pride in producing professional audio at prices that are much easier to swallow than most other professional mastering services, yet which still allow myself and other engineers to make a living helping artists that want to enhance their audio production skills.</p>

<h3 id="connor-eichinger---mastering-engineer">Connor Eichinger - Mastering Engineer</h3>

<p>Hailing from Pleasantville, New York, Connor is pursuing a degree in Music Industry with a minor in Recording. He plans to graduate in 2017. I brought Connor on to the Get Mastered team recently, as I was incredibly impressed by his natural talent for mixing and mastering, and his visible drive to produce the best finished project possible, no matter how long it takes.</p>

<p>Connor has years of experience working with audio in various contexts, including producing and recording, mixing and mastering, sound design, and film post production. He has composed and performed acousmatic music in a quadraphonic setting as well as through live sound diffusion with <a href="http://huseac.fas.harvard.edu/Hydra/">Harvard University’s Hydra loudspeaker orchestra</a>. Connor has also composed music for commercials and short films, and is currently finalizing a 5 track EP which will be his debut as a solo artist.</p>

<h3 id="lee-schuna---mastering-engineer">Lee Schuna - Mastering Engineer</h3>

<h4 id="producer-name-analogue-self">Producer name: Analogue Self</h4>

<p>From New Richmond, Wisconsin, Lee has been learning the art of recording since age 13. Starting out recording covers of songs for YouTube, he eventually started writing his own music and recording all the parts in his parent’s basement. Working with the limitations of lo-fi equipment and the old Intro version of Ableton, learning to creatively solve audio problems became hugely important to his process.</p>

<p>An alumni of Northeastern University’s Music Industry program, Lee spent time working in both campus recording studios, as a full time house engineer during the inaugural semester of the Digital Media Commons Studio. There, he worked with a variety of clients and taught workshops on a variety of topics.</p>

<p>After a 3 year long battle with tendinitis that prevented him from playing most instruments, Lee focused on electronic music production, and has since been very involved in making in techno, ambient, and music for film and stage. Sound design has been Lee’s primary interest after working on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8nZDq89UE">an award winning film</a> for Campus Movie Fest and getting involved in theatrical sound design. He’s been able to use the skills he learned from recording and mastering audio in other contexts to sculpt sound with attention to detail.</p>
