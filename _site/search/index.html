		link: "/back-to-basics/Preparing-Your-Mix/",
		content: "So, you’re ready to Get Mastered! The following are steps you should make sure to take before you send me your mix:1) Turn off any limiters or other plugins on the output bus2) Turn down the master fader -6dB3) Bounce in a high quality, lossless format4) Turn off any normalization or dithering while bouncingMore details on each of these steps can be found below:1) Turn off any limiters or other plugins on the output busI cannot stress the importance of this first step! If you have inserted any plugins on the output bus (also known as the master track) of your mix, please, please bypass them before you bounce the mix for mastering. A lot of the tricks I use to beef of the sonic quality of your mix rely on a certain level of dynamic range; if the mix is already limited, I can’t do much to remove that on my end, and I won’t be able to bring your song to its full potential.Here is an example of a song that will be very difficult for me to improve, because it has been heavily limited, and has little to no dynamic range (that is, there are not many ups and downs in the audio):In this specific example, the limiter actually added tons of distortion to the track that I could not remove! Bad bad bad!!!Now, here is an example of what your track should look like after turning off any output limiters:Beautiful, beautiful dynamics.It is important to also turn off other plugins on the output bus, such as compressors, for me to do the best job possible. “But Keenan,” you might shout, “the mix just isn’t the same without them!” If you are staunchly opposed to bypassing some output plugins, let’s compromise: send me one bounce with output plugins enabled, and one with them disabled.2) Turn down the master fader at least -6dBThe reasoning for this step is similar to step 1: I need to have a little extra space on top to do what I need to do. Please do me a favor and leave me 6dB of headroom by turning your master fader down -6dB before bouncing your mix.3) Bounce or export your mix in a high quality, lossless formatYour mix should be bounced in the same format in which it was recorded (generally, 24 bits with a sample rate of no less than 44.1kHz). If you recorded at a lesser quality, don’t sweat it. File formats should be lossless (that is to say, not mp3s!!!). Lossless file formats include .wav, .aiff, and .flac.4) Turn of any normalization or dithering when bouncing your mixNormalization will boost the volume of the track, destroying all those 6dB’s of headroom! Dithering is not necessary if you are sending me a high quality, lossless mix, as you should be.If you have any more questions on preparing your mixes for mastering, please don’t hesitate to contact me at services@getmastered.com"

		content: "So you’ve finished your mix, and everything sounds great. But when you listen to your final bounce next to commercial tracks, it just doesn’t sound quite right. Something is off, and it’s hard to put a finger on what. No matter how much you tweak, you just can’t get your tracks to sound like those produced by artists you love.I’ve been here! I’ve mixed music for years, and I know the feeling. Luckily, there’s an easy way to solve this problem:Ask Someone To Help!Mastering, at the most basic, basic level, is simply asking another engineer to help you make your sound better. And there’s no shame in getting help! Even the best mixing engineers in the world get their music mastered, because they know that another pair of ears always helps.The word mastering means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but to me, mastering means helping you make your track sound better. Despite this extremely general definition of the job, there are a few concrete steps I will typically go through to get this done:1) I Ask You What You WantAs I mentioned, many people often have different definitions of what mastering means to them, and if there is anything specific a client wants done, I like to have it in the front of my mind.During this step, I also like to get an idea of what my client wants their song to sound like. This may be a list of influences, or musical descriptors, but it really helps me get an idea of how to move forward and what to listen for.2) I Give It a ListenPerhaps obviously, before I start mastering your track, I’ll give it a critical listen, all the way through. This allows me to understand the message of the song, the feel of the song, and which instruments in the mix were felt to be most important by the mix engineer.During this step, I can also identify mix-level issues, and give you tips on how to make your mix better, before I even get to mastering.3) I Sculpt Tone AppropriatelyFinally, time to get my hands dirty! (my mouse dirty?) Often, a mix won’t come to me sounding perfect! I’ll do some genre-specific processing, including processing with EQ, multi-band compressors, exciters, stereo imagers, and sometimes even reverb! The key here is that I only tweak what is appropriate and needed for the song. I don’t under-do it, and I certainly don’t over-do it. Often mastering is a collection of subtle tweaks that leads to a big change in tone. 4) I Make It LouderOkay, okay!When a lot of people think of mastering, the one thing they have in mind is making their track louder. Often mixes come out sounding too quiet, especially when compared to commercial releases.The last thing I do when mastering a track is to make it louder in a genre specific way (that is to say, I won’t make your folk song sound like an EDM track, or vice versa). I use high quality limiters and an experienced ear (and maybe even other secret tricks) to make this as absolutely transparent as possible.So there you have it! If you decide to get mastered by me, this is what you’re paying for (or not paying for if you want to get get mastered for free!) As I’ve said ad nauseam, mastering means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and I will work with you to make sure I adhere to the definition you have in mind."

		content: "My name is Keenan, and for all of my life I have had a passion for really, really great sounding music. However, having self-produced my own music for many years, I know how difficult it can be to perform, record, mix, and master a song that you are completely proud of. In my experience, there was always that special “extra something” missing, and I was quick to realize an easy way to fix this issue: all I needed was someone to help!Of course, I am lucky enough to know a lot of audio engineers with different types of experience and tastes than I. But I know that a lot of musicians aren’t quite that fortunate, and Get Mastered is my way of helping those musicians.I created Get Mastered as a way for independent musicians to foster a direct, personal relationship with an experienced audio engineer, and make great sounding music, together.As part of our whole vibe, Get Mastered offers mastering services at rates that artists can actually afford. Plus, Get Mastered is the only place where you can test the waters, and get an absolutely, no joke, 100% free master without any commitment. That’s how confident I am you’ll love your mastered song.We also offer audio restoration services for podcasts, voiceovers, and anything else audio related. Any time you want to make your audio better, we are here to help (for inquiries on audio restoration, shoot us an email at services@getmastered.com).In part of my effort to help artists, I am also fostering a blog devoted to helping artists produce their own music, that I will update periodically with mixing, performance, and recording advice.
