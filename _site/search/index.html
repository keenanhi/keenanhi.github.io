		title: "Writing With Mixing In Mind",
		link: "/blog/lets-get-theoretical/Writing-With-Mixing-In-Mind/",
		content: "I like to think of writing a song like making a puzzle, and mixing a song like trying to actually put together the pieces of that puzzle. When I’m recording a composition I was not involved in creating from the start, it’s often a more challenging puzzle than if I’m making the pieces from scratch myself.In this post, which I received some requests for, I’ll walk through how to create those puzzle pieces yourself, using music theory as a guide. You’ll see that once you have the means to write parts that fit snuggly with each other, mixing and recording become much easier and sound completely natural!Please note: This post will take a little bit of music theory to get the most out of. At some point, I would love to have a guest on here to give a quick theory primer; for now, I’ve linked to some great music theory introductions on the bottom of this postBuilding your puzzle piecesThere are plenty of little tricks you can use during your writing process to make recording and mixing a breeze, and most of them boil down to writing different instrumental parts to fill different roles.It helps to think of things spatially on a piano. Say we are writing a song with a vocalist, a guitarist, a synth player, and a drummer. We’re going to make a shell of a song using just that information. Keep in mind that each of these instruments in this example can be substituted with any other instrument you normally use to write.I always write new parts by putting them into one of two categories (usually with some light overlap):  Parts that use a new section of the keyboard  Parts that reinforce a section of the keyboard that is already in useVocals (or, any melodic instrument)So with that in mind, let’s say I’m starting the song with a vocal melody, for example, that spans this range on the piano:Do re... You can see that my vocal part in this case ranges from C4 to E5, which is generally my most frequented area melodically as a baritone singer. This range works well for my voice - I’m not trying to push it to the limit and write a part that strains my voice and what it can naturally accomplish. It’s great to start with vocals for this reason, since vocal ranges are more variable than other instruments across different players (as opposed to piano, for instance, which can hit the same notes no matter who is playing it)Vocals are also unique in the sense that every head of every vocalist is different, and thus every vocalist has notes which resonate acoustically in their mouth, throat, and nasal cavity better than others, and are thus easier and more natural to sing. This combination of range and resonances often leads to certain keys being preferred by vocalists (I lean towards F, Bb and Ab, personally). In this case, we’ll pretend we’ve tried or had our vocalist try different keys, and we’ve picked the key of E major for this song.Guitar (or, any chordal instrument)The easiest next step in writing the song for me, since I’m also a guitar player, would be to add a guitar part. Since the vocals are going to be the main focus of the song in this case, I’ll want the guitar to sit behind them, and reinforce them. I’ll also want to fill out the keyboard a little bit more, so I’ll write a part that fills out the mids a bit (knowing that I have synth to fill out the highs or lows, where the guitar cannot reach naturally). Notice how I’m already using terms like “fill out the mids” during the writing process, rather than the mixing and recording process!Here is the range of my guitar part in green, with my vocal range still in blue:mi fa...You’ll notice here, I do have some overlap (indicated by the red arrow). It’s difficult to achieve complete isolation between parts in practice. Here I’m trying to illustrate that this style of writing often has overlap; as long as it’s only a few fleeting notes, this kind of overlap is negligible - we’re concerned with the region about which most of the notes in a part are clustered. Of course, avoiding overlap entirely  will almost always sound good in comparison!Guitar players may have noticed this, but it’s worth pointing out: this range (E2 to E4) would consist of chords spanning only three strings. That’s right! More often than not, it sounds great to leave unused notes for others to take, especially when those notes are better suited for other instruments. I very regularly omit the bottom note of the chord from my guitar part so that the bass player can have that note for themselves.  With any sort of mid-range instrument, I usually use a lot of chord inversions and root note omissions.In contrast, for some styles, like singer-songwriter and folk, full open chords are often played on guitar, since there are usually no other instruments to fill that role, and acoustic guitar is more often than not a star player in those style recordings, and can take a more central role in the song.Synth (or, any bass instrument)Next, we need to fill in those bass notes! Enter: the bass synth.so la...I’ve noted the bass synth’s range in magenta. You’ll notice again that we have an overlapping region on E2, noted by the red arrow. Don’t panic!Now we’ve used all of our non-percussive instruments. But wait - there’s still a ton of empty space at the top of the piano! Do we need to fill that in?Of course, we could fill that in with another instrument if we wanted. If I do this, I usually save it for the chorus sections of the song, to add some impact.However, I often find that I leave this region empty. The reason that this isn’t as noticeable as, say, a missing bass region part, is that all of the instruments we’ve added have higher frequency harmonics. These harmonics will fill in our higher frequencies when we mix - I’ll even usually find that when I’m mixing, there is too much competition up there, and I’ll have to chop out some high frequency harmonics of, say, the bass and guitar parts, to leave room for the vocal harmonics.Sometimes, I’ll even just add a non-pitched, higher frequency part, such as shaker, white noise, or cymbal crashes, to the chorus of songs. This adds some excitement and differentiates these sections from the rest of the song.Drums (or, any percussion instrument)Now, so far, our three instruments, vocals, guitar, and bass synth, have fallen into the “new section of the keyboard” category, to fill certain roles (from bullet 1 above: “Parts that use a new section of the keyboard”). Now that most of our keyboard is filled up, we can add percussion as a supporting player to beef up our song with a backbone (which fits bullet 2 from above: “Parts that reinforce a section of the keyboard that is already in use”)Here is a depiction of our percussion instruments, in orange, layered underneath all our other parts:ti do!I’ve noted the percussion as orange blocks because every drum, whether you care to think about it or not, has a fundamental frequency (so long as it’s been tuned!). I try to tune my drums to the key of the song when I can, as this really locks the backbone of the song into place, and sounds much more cohesive. Here are some tips for tuning acoustic drums - if you’re using electronic drums with a pitch control built in, you really have no excuse to leave them untuned!In this case, since our song is in E, I’ve tuned the kick drum (the lowest orange block) to a low E1, the fundamental of the track. Then, I’ve tuned two toms (the next two blocks, moving right) to a B1 and an E2, since B is the fifth in the key of E. My snare (the fourth block) is also a B, B2. Roots and fifths are great for drums, since you can use both for minor and major keys, and they are part of the arpeggio of the key. Remember, though: this is just an example - you can place your drums anywhere you’d like!I’ve also included an arbitrarily placed fifth and sixth orange block to denote a high hat and a crash cymbal. These may not sound pitched exactly, but they are up there to indicate that these will both be adding higher frequency content, and supporting some of the harmonics from our other instruments.This drum part is overlapping almost all of our other instrument regions! But that’s okay, because as most drum parts are, this will be a supporting part, rhythmically accenting different notes of the vocal melody, guitar chords, or bass synth, to glue the different regions together with a rhythmic backbone.Pick up the pieces"Sorry Grandma, rain check on the puzzles... I have to write music"Now we have a song that will practically mix itself! We’ve created our own puzzle pieces by partitioning our keyboard to different players, and it’s fairly straightforward to see how we’ll approach recording and mixing this song! Perhaps a condenser microphone to capture more high frequency harmonics on the vocals, some saturation on the guitar to fill up the mids even more… who knows! Once you’ve written a song this way, mixing and recording become easier, because you have a pre-defined frequency region for each instrument, dictated by the part itself.You can also easily keep writing and recording new parts if the song needs more beefing up, by adding more supporting players, such as some subtle piano chords, guitar doubling, or harmony vocals.This is a rather extreme example of partitioning the keyboard while writing; there’s nothing to stop you from writing three bass parts in a song, for example, but it’s certainly rare! Even in these extreme examples, however, you find that the two overlapping instruments work together and don’t fight each other.Remember, as with all things musical, these are just helpful guidelines. Try writing some new songs like this, and then break some rules and see how it sounds!Great music theory referencesHere are some great music theory references:Great primer from Sound on Sound that pairs well with this postFree online class from Berklee (can’t beat that!)A more thorough and pedagogical guideI’d love to hear your experiences writing with this technique in the comments. Next, I’m planning a post about how to use your music theory knowledge until it becomes second nature, so stay tuned!"

		content: "Why is the girl in this stock photo making this face?Is it because she’s psyched about her monochromatic outfit? Probably not.Is it because she just got asked to prom by the cutest boy in school? Guess again.Is it because she just got paid $30 to wear headphones in a stock photo shoot? Maybe, but for the sake of wrapping up this careening introduction, no.It’s because she’s listening to your newest mix, and she’s really really into it. Take another look: "Straight fire" she whispers before fainting on the spotBut why does she love your mix so much? Is it your new preamps, or the thirty-plus hours you spent penciling in de-breath-ing automation on all of your harmony vocal tracks? No way - she doesn’t care about any of that.She cares about how the mix sounds, to her. Not how the mix sounds to someone who has heard the underlying song countless times, and who has been through the entire recording and writing process. If this girl thought your mix was a little too high-end heavy, you’d be unwise to discard her opinions as uninformed, regardless of whether or not you agree (especially, in this case, since she is probably younger than you, and can hear more high end than you).Get more, and better, ears on your workWhat matters to me more than anything in terms of personal improvement is getting feedback on my work. At the end of the day, you want your mix to sound unequivocally great to anyone who listens - so it makes sense to get as many ears on your mix as possible. This may seem obvious, but truly take a second to think about how often you ask for feedback - even I don’t think that I ask for enough!Of course, however, quality trumps quantity. The best thing your mixing skills can benefit from, more-so than any amount of room treatment, high quality DAC’s, or expensive microphones, is an engaging, reliable group of friends with whom you can regularly and mutually grow your skills.Finding people as passionate as you are about mixing is an extremely rewarding experience, and you’ll find that you start thinking completely differently while mixing. Nowadays when I mix, I will sit down in front of my DAW, take a deep breath, and press play from the beginning, pretending like I have a peer in the room. Even when I don’t have people directly critiquing me, knowing that they will hear my mix later in the week during a weekly critiquing session makes me think completely differently, as though they are in the room next to me. I start focusing on bigger issues, like overall levels, and suddenly smaller things, like all that de-breath-ing, don’t matter at all (maybe those harmony vocals were too loud anyway!)I find that my mixing skills grow much more rapidly when I can rely on people to critically evaluate my work, and listen with different ears than mine, because I always bring myself back to the bigger issues at hand. It’s only when I go too far down the rabbit hole that I’m dissatisfied with my mixes - I often find a simple solution myself or am offered one by a peer when mixing this way.Start a listening group today with some peers - don’t put it off! Pretty soon you’ll see your mixes improve drastically, and you’ll be able to focus on the bigger issues at hand. Plus, you will have the motivation to get your mixes finished when you have a weekly or monthly commitment to do so.Oh, and it would be remiss of me not to mention that should you find yourself unable to gather your pals every Wednesday night, you can get feedback from us here!As our inaugural blog post, this has been quite the adventure for me. I would love to hear anyone’s experience mixing with friends in the comments!"

		content: "As mastering engineers, we have been passionate about music since we were toddlers. Read our bios below to learn more about us, and why we do what we do!Our Engineers:Keenan Hye - Founder and Mastering EngineerI am originally from Madison, Connecticut, and I have been producing music since I was in early high school. I recently earned a degree in Electrical Engineering and Music Recording, and am planning on pursuing a graduate degree in Acoustical Engineering.During the past five years, I have had experience researching human perception of audio quality, creating automated room equalization algorithms, and engineering directional hearing devices to aid people with hearing loss. All of this experience has given me a vast and varied understanding of topics important to mastering and our perception of music, including psychoacoustics, room acoustics, and digital audio processing.To satiate my right brain, I spend most of my down time writing original music and lyrics, and, of course, recording and mixing my own music as well. I grew up playing saxophone, but now I’m primarily a singer and guitarist. Despite these preferences, I truly enjoy learning and understanding any instrument I can get my hands on!The rest of the little free time I have left goes to coding and designing this website, as well as listening to podcasts (especially well-produced podcasts, such as Radiolab and Song Exploder).Helping people make great audio is absolutely my passion, and to me there is no substitute for the human touch that a real mastering engineer can add. I take pride in producing professional audio at prices that are much easier to swallow than most other professional mastering services, yet which still allow myself and other engineers to make a living helping artists that want to enhance their audio production skills.Connor Eichinger - Mastering EngineerHailing from Pleasantville, New York, Connor is pursuing a degree in Music Industry with a minor in Recording. He plans to graduate in 2017. I brought Connor on to the Get Mastered team recently, as I was incredibly impressed by his natural talent for mixing and mastering, and his visible drive to produce the best finished project possible, no matter how long it takes.Connor has years of experience working with audio in various contexts, including producing and recording, mixing and mastering, sound design, and film post production. He has composed and performed acousmatic music in a quadraphonic setting as well as through live sound diffusion with Harvard University’s Hydra loudspeaker orchestra. Connor has also composed music for commercials and short films, and is currently finalizing a 5 track EP which will be his debut as a solo artist.Lee Schuna - Mastering EngineerProducer name: Analogue SelfFrom New Richmond, Wisconsin, Lee has been learning the art of recording since age 13. Starting out recording covers of songs for YouTube, he eventually started writing his own music and recording all the parts in his parent’s basement. Working with the limitations of lo-fi equipment and the old Intro version of Ableton, learning to creatively solve audio problems became hugely important to his process.An alumni of Northeastern University’s Music Industry program, Lee spent time working in both campus recording studios, as a full time house engineer during the inaugural semester of the Digital Media Commons Studio. There, he worked with a variety of clients and taught workshops on a variety of topics.After a 3 year long battle with tendinitis that prevented him from playing most instruments, Lee focused on electronic music production, and has since been very involved in making in techno, ambient, and music for film and stage. Sound design has been Lee’s primary interest after working on an award winning film for Campus Movie Fest and getting involved in theatrical sound design. He’s been able to use the skills he learned from recording and mastering audio in other contexts to sculpt sound with attention to detail."

		content: "My name is Keenan, and for all of my life I have had a passion for really, really great sounding audio. I grew up recording my own original music and have never looked back, receiving a degree in Electrical Engineering and Music Recording. I’ve had experience researching human perception of audio quality, creating automated room equalization algorithms, and engineering directional hearing devices to aid people with hearing loss. I’m of course also an active musician, singing and playing guitar in a band, and learning whatever else I can get my hands on.Having self-produced my own music for many years, I know how difficult it can be to perform, record, mix, and master something that you are completely proud of. In my experience, there was always that special “extra something” missing. Before long I realized an easy way to make my audio better: get someone with more experience to help!I had heard of mastering being the stage where this “extra something” is added by professionals. Unfortunately, typical mastering services were completely beyond my budget, while any cheaper services or automated softwares I could find were not cutting it. Even more than that though, I wanted someone who knew what they were doing to listen to my music and not only give my track a professional sound, but give me feedback on what I could be doing better. And I couldn’t find that outside of my college classrooms.That is why I created Get Mastered: as a way for independent musicians, recording hobbyists, and podcasters to foster a direct relationship with an experienced audio engineer, and not only make great sounding audio, but learn how to become better producers themselves.I set out to make Get Mastered affordable for those who are serious about their work, and have based our rates and services off of direct feedback from clients. Plus, while we launch, we are offering an absolutely free master or mix feedback to show you how much of a difference we can make to your audio and skill development.Despite our extensive experience with audio, we are just launching as a business, so please let us know if you see anything you think we can improve. Whether technological, or concerning any part of our service, please send all feedback, questions, or concerns to services@getmastered.com.Here’s to making great audio, together!"

Enter: the bass synth.so la...I’ve noted the bass synth’s range in magenta. You’ll notice again that we have an overlapping region on E2, noted by the red arrow. Don’t panic!Now we’ve used all of our non-percussive instruments. But wait - there’s still a ton of empty space at the top of the piano! Do we need to fill that in?Of course, we could fill that in with another instrument if we wanted. If I do this, I usually save it for the chorus sections of the song, to add some impact.However, I often find that I leave this region empty. The reason that this isn’t as noticeable as, say, a missing bass region part, is that all of the instruments we’ve added have higher frequency harmonics. These harmonics will fill in our higher frequencies when we mix - I’ll even usually find that when I’m mixing, there is too much competition up there, and I’ll have to chop out some high frequency harmonics of, say, the bass and guitar parts, to leave room for the vocal harmonics.Sometimes, I’ll even just add a non-pitched, higher frequency part, such as shaker, white noise, or cymbal crashes, to the chorus of songs. This adds some excitement and differentiates these sections from the rest of the song.Drums (or, any percussion instrument)Now, so far, our three instruments, vocals, guitar, and bass synth, have fallen into the “new section of the keyboard” category, to fill certain roles (from bullet 1 above: “Parts that use a new section of the keyboard”). Now that most of our keyboard is filled up, we can add percussion as a supporting player to beef up our song with a backbone (which fits bullet 2 from above: “Parts that reinforce a section of the keyboard that is already in use”)Here is a depiction of our percussion instruments, in orange, layered underneath all our other parts:ti do!I’ve noted the percussion as orange blocks because every drum, whether you care to think about it or not, has a fundamental frequency (so long as it’s been tuned!). I try to tune my drums to the key of the song when I can, as this really locks the backbone of the song into place, and sounds much more cohesive. Here are some tips for tuning acoustic drums - if you’re using electronic drums with a pitch control built in, you really have no excuse to leave them untuned!In this case, since our song is in E, I’ve tuned the kick drum (the lowest orange block) to a low E1, the fundamental of the track. Then, I’ve tuned two toms (the next two blocks, moving right) to a B1 and an E2, since B is the fifth in the key of E. My snare (the fourth block) is also a B, B2. Roots and fifths are great for drums, since you can use both for minor and major keys, and they are part of the arpeggio of the key. Remember, though: this is just an example - you can place your drums anywhere you’d like!I’ve also included an arbitrarily placed fifth and sixth orange block to denote a high hat and a crash cymbal. These may not sound pitched exactly, but they are up there to indicate that these will both be adding higher frequency content, and supporting some of the harmonics from our other instruments.This drum part is overlapping almost all of our other instrument regions! But that’s okay, because as most drum parts are, this will be a supporting part, rhythmically accenting different notes of the vocal melody, guitar chords, or bass synth, to glue the different regions together with a rhythmic backbone.Pick up the pieces"Sorry Grandma, rain check on the puzzles... I have to write music"Now we have a song that will practically mix itself! We’ve created our own puzzle pieces by partitioning our keyboard to different players, and it’s fairly straightforward to see how we’ll approach recording and mixing this song! Perhaps a condenser microphone to capture more high frequency harmonics on the vocals, some saturation on the guitar to fill up the mids even more… who knows! Once you’ve written a song this way, mixing and recording become easier, because you have a pre-defined frequency region for each instrument, dictated by the part itself.You can also easily keep writing and recording new parts if the song needs more beefing up, by adding more supporting players, such as some subtle piano chords, guitar doubling, or harmony vocals.This is a rather extreme example of partitioning the keyboard while writing; there’s nothing to stop you from writing three bass parts in a song, for example, but it’s certainly rare! Even in these extreme examples, however, you find that the two overlapping instruments work together and don’t fight each other.Remember, as with all things musical, these are just helpful guidelines. Try writing some new songs like this, and then break some rules and see how it sounds!Great music theory referencesHere are some great music theory references:Great primer from Sound on Sound that pairs well with this postFree online class from Berklee (can’t beat that!)A more thorough and pedagogical guideI’d love to hear your experiences writing with this technique in the comments. Next, I’m planning a post about how to use your music theory knowledge until it becomes second nature, so stay tuned!"

		content: "Why is the girl in this stock photo making this face?Is it because she’s psyched about her monochromatic outfit? Probably not.Is it because she just got asked to prom by the cutest boy in school? Guess again.Is it because she just got paid $30 to wear headphones in a stock photo shoot? Maybe, but for the sake of wrapping up this careening introduction, no.It’s because she’s listening to your newest mix, and she’s really really into it. Take another look: "Straight fire" she whispers before fainting on the spotBut why does she love your mix so much? Is it your new preamps, or the thirty-plus hours you spent penciling in de-breath-ing automation on all of your harmony vocal tracks? No way - she doesn’t care about any of that.She cares about how the mix sounds, to her. Not how the mix sounds to someone who has heard the underlying song countless times, and who has been through the entire recording and writing process. If this girl thought your mix was a little too high-end heavy, you’d be unwise to discard her opinions as uninformed, regardless of whether or not you agree (especially, in this case, since she is probably younger than you, and can hear more high end than you).Get more, and better, ears on your workWhat matters to me more than anything in terms of personal improvement is getting feedback on my work. At the end of the day, you want your mix to sound unequivocally great to anyone who listens - so it makes sense to get as many ears on your mix as possible. This may seem obvious, but truly take a second to think about how often you ask for feedback - even I don’t think that I ask for enough!Of course, however, quality trumps quantity. The best thing your mixing skills can benefit from, more-so than any amount of room treatment, high quality DAC’s, or expensive microphones, is an engaging, reliable group of friends with whom you can regularly and mutually grow your skills.Finding people as passionate as you are about mixing is an extremely rewarding experience, and you’ll find that you start thinking completely differently while mixing. Nowadays when I mix, I will sit down in front of my DAW, take a deep breath, and press play from the beginning, pretending like I have a peer in the room. Even when I don’t have people directly critiquing me, knowing that they will hear my mix later in the week during a weekly critiquing session makes me think completely differently, as though they are in the room next to me. I start focusing on bigger issues, like overall levels, and suddenly smaller things, like all that de-breath-ing, don’t matter at all (maybe those harmony vocals were too loud anyway!)I find that my mixing skills grow much more rapidly when I can rely on people to critically evaluate my work, and listen with different ears than mine, because I always bring myself back to the bigger issues at hand. It’s only when I go too far down the rabbit hole that I’m dissatisfied with my mixes - I often find a simple solution myself or am offered one by a peer when mixing this way.Start a listening group today with some peers - don’t put it off! Pretty soon you’ll see your mixes improve drastically, and you’ll be able to focus on the bigger issues at hand. Plus, you will have the motivation to get your mixes finished when you have a weekly or monthly commitment to do so.Oh, and it would be remiss of me not to mention that should you find yourself unable to gather your pals every Wednesday night, you can get feedback from us here!As our inaugural blog post, this has been quite the adventure for me. I would love to hear anyone’s experience mixing with friends in the comments!"

		content: "As mastering engineers, we have been passionate about music since we were toddlers. Read our bios below to learn more about us, and why we do what we do!Our Engineers:Keenan Hye - Founder and Mastering EngineerI am originally from Madison, Connecticut, and I have been producing music since I was in early high school. I recently earned a degree in Electrical Engineering and Music Recording, and am planning on pursuing a graduate degree in Acoustical Engineering.During the past five years, I have had experience researching human perception of audio quality, creating automated room equalization algorithms, and engineering directional hearing devices to aid people with hearing loss. All of this experience has given me a vast and varied understanding of topics important to mastering and our perception of music, including psychoacoustics, room acoustics, and digital audio processing.To satiate my right brain, I spend most of my down time writing original music and lyrics, and, of course, recording and mixing my own music as well. I grew up playing saxophone, but now I’m primarily a singer and guitarist. Despite these preferences, I truly enjoy learning and understanding any instrument I can get my hands on!The rest of the little free time I have left goes to coding and designing this website, as well as listening to podcasts (especially well-produced podcasts, such as Radiolab and Song Exploder).Helping people make great audio is absolutely my passion, and to me there is no substitute for the human touch that a real mastering engineer can add. I take pride in producing professional audio at prices that are much easier to swallow than most other professional mastering services, yet which still allow myself and other engineers to make a living helping artists that want to enhance their audio production skills.Connor Eichinger - Mastering EngineerHailing from Pleasantville, New York, Connor is pursuing a degree in Music Industry with a minor in Recording. He plans to graduate in 2017. I brought Connor on to the Get Mastered team recently, as I was incredibly impressed by his natural talent for mixing and mastering, and his visible drive to produce the best finished project possible, no matter how long it takes.Connor has years of experience working with audio in various contexts, including producing and recording, mixing and mastering, sound design, and film post production. He has composed and performed acousmatic music in a quadraphonic setting as well as through live sound diffusion with Harvard University’s Hydra loudspeaker orchestra. Connor has also composed music for commercials and short films, and is currently finalizing a 5 track EP which will be his debut as a solo artist.Lee Schuna - Mastering EngineerProducer name: Analogue SelfFrom New Richmond, Wisconsin, Lee has been learning the art of recording since age 13. Starting out recording covers of songs for YouTube, he eventually started writing his own music and recording all the parts in his parent’s basement. Working with the limitations of lo-fi equipment and the old Intro version of Ableton, learning to creatively solve audio problems became hugely important to his process.An alumni of Northeastern University’s Music Industry program, Lee spent time working in both campus recording studios, as a full time house engineer during the inaugural semester of the Digital Media Commons Studio. There, he worked with a variety of clients and taught workshops on a variety of topics.After a 3 year long battle with tendinitis that prevented him from playing most instruments, Lee focused on electronic music production, and has since been very involved in making in techno, ambient, and music for film and stage. Sound design has been Lee’s primary interest after working on an award winning film for Campus Movie Fest and getting involved in theatrical sound design. He’s been able to use the skills he learned from recording and mastering audio in other contexts to sculpt sound with attention to detail."

		content: "My name is Keenan, and for all of my life I have had a passion for really, really great sounding audio. I grew up recording my own original music and have never looked back, receiving a degree in Electrical Engineering and Music Recording. I’ve had experience researching human perception of audio quality, creating automated room equalization algorithms, and engineering directional hearing devices to aid people with hearing loss. I’m of course also an active musician, singing and playing guitar in a band, and learning whatever else I can get my hands on.Having self-produced my own music for many years, I know how difficult it can be to perform, record, mix, and master something that you are completely proud of. In my experience, there was always that special “extra something” missing. Before long I realized an easy way to make my audio better: get someone with more experience to help!I had heard of mastering being the stage where this “extra something” is added by professionals. Unfortunately, typical mastering services were completely beyond my budget, while any cheaper services or automated softwares I could find were not cutting it. Even more than that though, I wanted someone who knew what they were doing to listen to my music and not only give my track a professional sound, but give me feedback on what I could be doing better. And I couldn’t find that outside of my college classrooms.That is why I created Get Mastered: as a way for independent musicians, recording hobbyists, and podcasters to foster a direct relationship with an experienced audio engineer, and not only make great sounding audio, but learn how to become better producers themselves.I set out to make Get Mastered affordable for those who are serious about their work, and have based our rates and services off of direct feedback from clients. Plus, while we launch, we are offering an absolutely free master or mix feedback to show you how much of a difference we can make to your audio and skill development.Despite our extensive experience with audio, we are just launching as a business, so please let us know if you see anything you think we can improve. Whether technological, or concerning any part of our service, please send all feedback, questions, or concerns to services@getmastered.com.Here’s to making great audio, together!"
