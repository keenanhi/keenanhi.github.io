		content: "Music mastering means different things to different people. Of course, there are some technical aspects of mastering that most agree upon - but to us at Get Mastered, there are a few hugely important parts of the mastering process that are lost with cheap mastering services and auto-“mastering” softwares.Mastering is, in essence, the process of transforming a mix which has been bounced or exported as one stereo audio file into a finalized, ready to release song.A well mastered song will sound  cohesive,  professional,  warm,  great in any format,  great through any sound system,  great in any space,  and loud,while still retaining the overall style, vision, and dynamics of the original mix. This requires a vast amount of technical know-how as well as objective, experienced ears.Our mastering process at Get Mastered includes 6 important steps:Step 1 - Getting to know YOUStep 2 - FeedbackStep 3 - CohesionStep 4 - TranslationStep 5 - Loudness!Step 6 - ReviewStep 1 - Getting to know YOUIn music, everyone has their own style and tastes. Most mastering services don’t take this into account, but our engineers at Get Mastered truly work hard to understand you as a musician or producer.During this stage, we ask you to send us music you consider beautifully produced, so that we can get an idea of what you are working towards. We also ask you to send us some of your previous musical works, so we can get a sense of your own style - which is something we never want to compromise!Step 2 - FeedbackIn any profession, feedback is extremely important, and music production is no different. Independent music production is rapidly growing, and with it a loss of feedback loops between multiple engineers working together.For our next step, you send us your best mix, and we work with you to bring it to your quality standards, if it is not there already. This is a vital step to mastering that is completely lost with cheap services and auto-“mastering” software. There are some things that are truly impossible to fix in the mastering stage without compromising other areas of the mix, and it is extremely important we iron out any mix-level issues before mastering.Through this step, our clients are also able to improve their own mixing skills, and learn straight from the experts!Step 3 - CohesionNext, our engineers take the reigns.Often times, before mastering, a song can sound more like a “mix” than a “song”. During this stage of the mastering process, we perform extremely precise, high quality analog-emulated processing to gel the mix together without sacrificing its overall sound. We don’t just slap on a preset with a mastering suite plug-in - every mix we work on has different needs, and we treat each song only with the processing it needs.This stage is where the magic happens, so to speak - afterwards, your song will sound crisp, warm, and cohesive.Step 4 - TranslationThe next step is making sure your music sound great everywhere, or making it translate well to different  environments. Sure, your mix sounds good in the studio - but how does it sound in a car? Over the radio? As an MP3? On Spotify? On vinyl? On headphones? On cheap laptop speakers?This is a vital stage of mastering that is - again - completely lost with cheap services and auto-“mastering” software… noticing a theme here?Step 5 - Loudness!Finally, after your song is sounding amazing, we make it loud without sacrificing dynamics.We don’t just slap a limiter on the output and call it a day - it is actually extremely difficult to increase the apparent volume of a song without sacrificing dynamics, warmth, and low-end punchiness, and there is a lot of nuance involved in this stage of our mastering. The track you receive from us will ultimately be as loud as you would like us to make it!Step 6 - ReviewOnce all of our engineers sign off on how the master sounds, we send it back to you for review. We tweak everything to your liking, to make sure you are getting the sound your music deserves. Our work is done only when you are completely and fully satisfied with how your music sounds! We care about our clients, and don’t want you leaving with anything until it blows you away.At Get Mastered, our mission is simple: give you the best sounding music possible. We know how to do it, and we can’t wait to show you. Try us out today, and see how your music can sound when you Get Mastered!"

		title: "Who We Are",

		content: "As mastering engineers, we have been passionate about music since we were toddlers. Read our bios below to learn more about us, and why we do what we do!Our Engineers:Keenan Hye - Founder and Mastering EngineerMy name is Keenan, and I’m currently a candidate for a Masters of Engineering in Acoustics at Penn State University. I am originally from Madison, Connecticut, and I have been producing music since I was in early high school. I earned my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Music Recording, and have years of practical experience under my belt.During the past five years, I have had experience researching human perception of audio quality, creating automated room equalization algorithms, and engineering directional hearing devices to aid people with hearing loss. All of this experience has given me a vast and varied understanding of topics important to mastering and our perception of music, including psychoacoustics, room acoustics, and digital audio processing.To satiate my right brain, I spend most of my down time writing original music and lyrics, and, of course, recording and mixing my own music as well. I grew up playing saxophone, but now I’m primarily a singer and guitarist.Helping people make great audio is absolutely my passion, and to me there is no substitute for the human touch that a real mastering engineer can add. I take pride in producing professional audio at prices that are much easier to swallow than most other professional mastering services, yet which still allow myself and other engineers to make a living helping artists that want to enhance their audio production skills.If you would like to learn more about me, my personal website can be found here.Connor Eichinger - Mastering EngineerHailing from Pleasantville, New York, Connor is pursuing a degree in Music Industry with a minor in Recording. He plans to graduate in 2017. I brought Connor on to the Get Mastered team recently, as I was incredibly impressed by his natural talent for mixing and mastering, and his visible drive to produce the best finished project possible, no matter how long it takes.Connor has years of experience working with audio in various contexts, including producing and recording, mixing and mastering, sound design, and film post production. He has composed and performed acousmatic music in a quadraphonic setting as well as through live sound diffusion with Harvard University’s Hydra loudspeaker orchestra. Connor has also composed music for commercials and short films, and is currently finalizing a 5 track EP which will be his debut as a solo artist.Lee Schuna - Mastering EngineerProducer name: Analogue SelfFrom New Richmond, Wisconsin, Lee has been learning the art of recording since age 13. Starting out recording covers of songs for YouTube, he eventually started writing his own music and recording all the parts in his parent’s basement. Working with the limitations of lo-fi equipment and the old Intro version of Ableton, learning to creatively solve audio problems became hugely important to his process.An alumni of Northeastern University’s Music Industry program, Lee spent time working in both campus recording studios, as a full time house engineer during the inaugural semester of the Digital Media Commons Studio. There, he worked with a variety of clients and taught workshops on a variety of topics.After a 3 year long battle with tendinitis that prevented him from playing most instruments, Lee focused on electronic music production, and has since been very involved in making in techno, ambient, and music for film and stage. Sound design has been Lee’s primary interest after working on an award winning film for Campus Movie Fest and getting involved in theatrical sound design. He’s been able to use the skills he learned from recording and mastering audio in other contexts to sculpt sound with attention to detail."

		content: "My name is Keenan, and for all of my life I have had a passion for really, really great sounding recordings. I grew up recording my own original music and have never looked back - I’m currently a candidate for a Masters of Engineering in Acoustics and received my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Music Recording. I’ve had experience researching human perception of audio quality, creating automated room equalization algorithms, and engineering directional hearing devices to aid people with hearing loss. I’m of course also an active musician, singing and playing guitar in a band, and messing around with whatever instruments I can get my hands on.Having self-produced my own music for many years, I know how difficult it can be to perform, record, mix, and master something that you are completely proud of. In my experience, there was always that special “extra something” missing. Before long I realized an easy way to make my audio better: get someone with more experience to help!I had heard of mastering being the stage where this “extra something” is added by professionals. Unfortunately, typical mastering services were completely beyond my budget, while any cheaper services or automated softwares I could find were not cutting it at all. Even more than that though, I wanted someone who knew what they were doing to listen to my music and not only give my track a professional sound, but give me feedback on what I could be doing better. And I couldn’t find that outside of my college classrooms.That is why I created Get Mastered: as a way for musicians, recording hobbyists, and other audio professionals to foster a direct relationship with an experienced mastering engineer, and not only create amazing recordings, but learn how to become better producers in the process.Here’s to making amazing music, together!"
