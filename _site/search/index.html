		content: "Why is the girl in this stock photo making this face?Is it because she’s psyched about her monochromatic outfit? Probably not.Is it because she just got asked to prom by the cutest boy in school? Guess again.Is it because she just got paid $30 to wear headphones in a stock photo shoot? Maybe, but for the sake of wrapping up this careening introduction, no.It’s because she’s listening to your newest mix, and she’s really really into it. Take another look: "Straight fire" she whispers before fainting on the spotBut why does she love your mix so much? Is it your new preamps, or the thirty-plus hours you spent penciling in de-breath-ing automation on all of your harmony vocal tracks? No way - she doesn’t care about any of that.She cares about how the mix sounds, to her. Not how the mix sounds to someone who has heard the underlying song countless times, and who has been through the entire recording and writing process. If this girl thought your mix was a little too high-end heavy, you’d be unwise to discard her opinions as uninformed, regardless of whether or not you agree (especially, in this case, since she is probably younger than you, and can hear more high end than you).Get more, and better, ears on your workWhat matters to me more than anything in terms of personal improvement is getting feedback on my work. At the end of the day, you want your mix to sound unequivocally great to anyone who listens - so it makes sense to get as many ears on your mix as possible. This may seem obvious, but truly take a second to think about how often you ask for feedback - even I don’t think that I ask for enough!Of course, however, quality trumps quantity. The best thing your mixing skills can benefit from, more-so than any amount of room treatment, high quality DAC’s, or expensive microphones, is an engaging, reliable group of friends with whom you can regularly and mutually grow your skills.Finding people as passionate as you are about mixing is an extremely rewarding experience, and you’ll find that you start thinking completely differently while mixing. Nowadays when I mix, I will sit down in front of my DAW, take a deep breath, and press play from the beginning, pretending like I have a peer in the room. Even when I don’t have people directly critiquing me, knowing that they will hear my mix later in the week during a weekly critiquing session makes me think completely differently, as though they are in the room next to me. I start focusing on bigger issues, like overall levels, and suddenly smaller things, like all that de-breath-ing, don’t matter at all (maybe those harmony vocals were too loud anyway!)I find that my mixing skills grow much more rapidly when I can rely on people to critically evaluate my work, and listen with different ears than mine, because I always bring myself back to the bigger issues at hand. It’s only when I go too far down the rabbit hole that I’m dissatisfied with my mixes - I often find a simple solution myself or am offered one by a peer when mixing this way.Start a listening group today with some peers - don’t put it off! Pretty soon you’ll see your mixes improve drastically, and you’ll be able to focus on the bigger issues at hand. Plus, you will have the motivation to get your mixes finished when you have a weekly or monthly commitment to do so.Oh, and it would be remiss of me not to mention that should you find yourself unable to gather your pals every Wednesday night, you can get feedback from us here!As our inaugural blog post, this has been quite the adventure for me. I would love to hear anyone’s experience mixing with friends in the comments!"

		content: "As mastering engineers, we have been passionate about music since we were toddlers. Read our bios below to learn more about us, and why we do what we do!Our Engineers:Keenan Hye - Founder and Mastering EngineerI am originally from Madison, Connecticut, and I have been producing music since I was in early high school. I recently earned a degree in Electrical Engineering and Music Recording, and am planning on pursuing a graduate degree in Acoustical Engineering.During the past five years, I have had experience researching human perception of audio quality, creating automated room equalization algorithms, and engineering directional hearing devices to aid people with hearing loss. All of this experience has given me a vast and varied understanding of topics important to mastering and our perception of music, including psychoacoustics, room acoustics, and digital audio processing.To satiate my right brain, I spend most of my down time writing original music and lyrics, and, of course, recording and mixing my own music as well. I grew up playing saxophone, but now I’m primarily a singer and guitarist. Despite these preferences, I truly enjoy learning and understanding any instrument I can get my hands on!The rest of the little free time I have left goes to coding and designing this website, as well as listening to podcasts (especially well-produced podcasts, such as Radiolab and Song Exploder).Helping people make great audio is absolutely my passion, and to me there is no substitute for the human touch that a real mastering engineer can add. I take pride in producing professional audio at prices that are much easier to swallow than most other professional mastering services, yet which still allow myself and other engineers to make a living helping artists that want to enhance their audio production skills.Connor Eichinger - Mastering EngineerHailing from Pleasantville, New York, Connor is pursuing a degree in Music Industry with a minor in Recording. He plans to graduate in 2017. I brought Connor on to the Get Mastered team recently, as I was incredibly impressed by his natural talent for mixing and mastering, and his visible drive to produce the best finished project possible, no matter how long it takes.Connor has years of experience working with audio in various contexts, including producing and recording, mixing and mastering, sound design, and film post production. He has composed and performed acousmatic music in a quadraphonic setting as well as through live sound diffusion with Harvard University’s Hydra loudspeaker orchestra. Connor has also composed music for commercials and short films, and is currently finalizing a 5 track EP which will be his debut as a solo artist.Lee Schuna - Mastering EngineerProducer name: Analogue SelfFrom New Richmond, Wisconsin, Lee has been learning the art of recording since age 13. Starting out recording covers of songs for YouTube, he eventually started writing his own music and recording all the parts in his parent’s basement. Working with the limitations of lo-fi equipment and the old Intro version of Ableton, learning to creatively solve audio problems became hugely important to his process.An alumni of Northeastern University’s Music Industry program, Lee spent time working in both campus recording studios, as a full time house engineer during the inaugural semester of the Digital Media Commons Studio. There, he worked with a variety of clients and taught workshops on a variety of topics.After a 3 year long battle with tendinitis that prevented him from playing most instruments, Lee focused on electronic music production, and has since been very involved in making in techno, ambient, and music for film and stage. Sound design has been Lee’s primary interest after working on an award winning film for Campus Movie Fest and getting involved in theatrical sound design. He’s been able to use the skills he learned from recording and mastering audio in other contexts to sculpt sound with attention to detail."

I grew up recording my own original music and have never looked back, receiving a degree in Electrical Engineering and Music Recording. I’ve had experience researching human perception of audio quality, creating automated room equalization algorithms, and engineering directional hearing devices to aid people with hearing loss. I’m of course also an active musician, singing and playing guitar in a band, and learning whatever else I can get my hands on.Having self-produced my own music for many years, I know how difficult it can be to perform, record, mix, and master something that you are completely proud of. In my experience, there was always that special “extra something” missing. Before long I realized an easy way to make my audio better: get someone with more experience to help!I had heard of mastering being the stage where this “extra something” is added by professionals. Unfortunately, typical mastering services were completely beyond my budget, while any cheaper services or automated softwares I could find were not cutting it. Even more than that though, I wanted someone who knew what they were doing to listen to my music and not only give my track a professional sound, but give me feedback on what I could be doing better. And I couldn’t find that outside of my college classrooms.That is why I created Get Mastered: as a way for independent musicians, recording hobbyists, and podcasters to foster a direct relationship with an experienced audio engineer, and not only make great sounding audio, but learn how to become better producers themselves.I set out to make Get Mastered affordable for those who are serious about their work, and have based our rates and services off of direct feedback from clients. Plus, while we launch, we are offering an absolutely free master or mix feedback to show you how much of a difference we can make to your audio and skill development.Despite our extensive experience with audio, we are just launching as a business, so please let us know if you see anything you think we can improve. Whether technological, or concerning any part of our service, please send all feedback, questions, or concerns to services@getmastered.com.Here’s to making great audio, together!"
