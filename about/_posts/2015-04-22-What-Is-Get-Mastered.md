It's a great time to be a self-producing musician. But despite easy access to recording programs, mastering a few songs can often cost an arm and a leg, specifically an arm and a leg dressed in a Italian tailored suit.

**Get Mastered offers mastering services at a rate artists can actually afford.** Plus, Get Mastered is the *only* site where you can test the waters, and get an [absolutely, no joke, 100% free master](/free-master) without any commitment. That's how confident I am you'll love what you hear.

In addition to being the best place to get your music mastered online, Get Mastered is also a blog devoted to teaching artists how easy it can be to produce high quality, professional sounding recordings by beefing up that pink matter *between* your ears with recording and mixing knowledge.

<!--###What if I am totally, *totally* new to this stuff?

This blog is aimed at musicians of any experience level. The material is explained in a way that is simple to understand, yet still covers the full breadth of the topic, including dips into the worlds of music theory, writing, acoustics, psychoacoustics, math (*dear god no!*), and signal processing, among other bordering fields.  

To get the most out of the blog, however, it is super helpful to have some basic foundational knowledge of digital audio recording and production. If words like:

- Mastering
- Equalization, or
- Dithering

sound foreign to you, you should check out [the Get Started mini-series](/mini-series/getting-started/Get-Started-Part-1/). This is where I explain a lot of that pesky jargon, in a way that is very easy to digest.-->

###What if I want to tell you that you're wrong, or dumb or something?

I have comment sections at the bottom of all my posts. Get Mastered is meant to be a collaborative learning environment; it doesnâ€™t work unless you make your thoughts known, boost good comments, and, of course... *ask questions!* I take care to answer all questions in the comments as quickly as possible.
