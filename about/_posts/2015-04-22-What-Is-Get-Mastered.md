**A quick note to the reader: This site is currently under construction, though I am still [accepting submissions for a free master](/free-master) and [taking clients](/mastering-services)**

It's a great time to be a self-producing musician. But despite easy access to recording programs, so many resources remain inaccessible to musicians looking to self-produce, due to a combination of limited capital investment, recording and mixing myths, and old industry separations of power.

Get Mastered is a blog devoted to teaching artists how easy it can be to produce high quality, professional sounding recordings by beefing up that pink matter *between* your ears with recording and mixing knowledge.

###What's with the name?

This blog is named Get Mastered because in addition to being a resource to learn how to record and mix music, it is also the absolute best place to get your music mastered.

[Find out how I can give you such low rates here.](/mastering-services)

###What if I am totally, *totally* new to this stuff?

This blog is aimed at musicians of any experience level. The material is explained in a way that is simple to understand, yet still covers the full breadth of the topic, including dips into the worlds of music theory, writing, acoustics, psychoacoustics, math (*dear god no!*), and signal processing, among other bordering fields.  

To get the most out of the blog, however, it is super helpful to have some basic foundational knowledge of digital audio recording and production. If words like:

- Mastering
- Equalization, or
- Dithering

sound foreign to you, you should check out [the Get Started mini-series](/mini-series/getting-started/Get-Started-Part-1/). This is where I explain a lot of that pesky jargon, in a way that is very easy to digest.

The last section of this mini-series also includes the software you will need to do your own recording and mixing, so if you don’t already have your own setup, make sure you don’t miss out on that!

###What if I want to tell you that you're wrong, or dumb or something?

I have comment sections at the bottom of all my posts. Get Mastered is meant to be a collaborative learning environment; it doesn’t work unless you make your thoughts known, boost good comments, and, of course... *ask questions!*

(I take care to answer all questions in the comments as quickly as possible!)

###Why do you do this anyway? What's in it for you, audio-boy?

I do all of this because it’s what I love to do. I maintain the website, I master the music, I write the posts; it’s all a one-man production, and it’s a lot of hard work. 

If you like what I’m doing, show your appreciation by being a part of the community, telling your friends, and...  *asking questions!*
