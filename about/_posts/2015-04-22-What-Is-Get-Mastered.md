My name is Keenan, and for all of my life I have had a passion for really, really great sounding music. 

However, having self-produced my own music for many years, I know how difficult it can be to perform, record, mix, and master a song that you are completely proud of. In my experience, there was always that special "extra something" missing, and I was quick to realize an easy way to fix this issue: all I needed was someone who knew a little bit more than me to help!

Of course, I am lucky enough to know a lot of audio engineers with different types of experience and tastes than I. But I know that a lot of musicians aren't quite that fortunate, and Get Mastered is my way of helping those musicians.

**I created Get Mastered as a way for independent musicians to foster a direct, personal relationship with an experienced audio engineer, and make great sounding music, together.**

As part of my whole vibe, **Get Mastered offers mastering services at rates that artists can actually afford.** Plus, Get Mastered is the *only* place where you can test the waters, and get an [absolutely, no joke, 100% free master and mix consultation](/free-master) without any commitment. That's how confident I am you'll love your mastered song.

In part of my effort to help musicians, I am also fostering a blog devoted to helping artists produce their own music, that I will update periodically with performance, recording, and mixing advice. 

Why mastering? To understand why I believe the mastering process to be a perfect time to get help making your music shine, read my next post on the blog, [What is Mastering?](/back-to-basics/What-Is-Mastering/).



<!--###What if I am totally, *totally* new to this stuff?

This blog is aimed at musicians of any experience level. The material is explained in a way that is simple to understand, yet still covers the full breadth of the topic, including dips into the worlds of music theory, writing, acoustics, psychoacoustics, math (*dear god no!*), and signal processing, among other bordering fields.  

To get the most out of the blog, however, it is super helpful to have some basic foundational knowledge of digital audio recording and production. If words like:

- Mastering
- Equalization, or
- Dithering

sound foreign to you, you should check out [the Get Started mini-series](/mini-series/getting-started/Get-Started-Part-1/). This is where I explain a lot of that pesky jargon, in a way that is very easy to digest.-->

<!--###What if I want to tell you that you're wrong, or dumb or something?

I have comment sections at the bottom of all my posts. Get Mastered is meant to be a collaborative learning environment; it doesnâ€™t work unless you make your thoughts known, boost good comments, and, of course... *ask questions!* I take care to answer all questions in the comments as quickly as possible.-->
