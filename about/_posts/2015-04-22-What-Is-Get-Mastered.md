Living on the cusp of insane technological inovations like autonomous automobiles, smart watches, and [freaky dog robot things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8YjvHYbZ9w), it confuses me how the technological world of the independent musician has remained so stagnant. There is such a wealth of knowledge out there that remains inaccessible to musicians, due to a combination of jargon, myths, and old industry practices and separations, particularly the separation of artist and producer.

Get Mastered is a blog devoted to teaching artists how easy it can be to produce high quality, professional music with no background techincal knowledge.

###What's with the name?

This blog is named Get Mastered because it focuses on the mastering process, which is something I've found to be completely innaccessible to musicians with non-technical backgrounds. 

Don't know what mastering is? We'll get there. 

Don't know how to record music, or mix music either? We'll get there too. 

Get Mastered is not just a resource for mastering; it's a resource for everything an artist needs to become a professional sounding producer.

Another reason this blog is named Get Mastered: you can [get mastered by me, for free](/#get_mastered). More on that later.

###How does this thing work?

To show you just how easy it is to master your own music, I structure the blog with a rotation of posts, which include:

**1) A Reader Gets Mastered**: Yes, I, the omnipotent voice of this blog, master a song for one of you! I show you what I did, and why I did it. With the consent of the artist, I offer the unmastered track up for download, so you to try your hand at it, either following along with me or, hey, even trying to do a better job than me!

**2) Digging In**: I dig in to a particularly important part of the mastering process from the last “A Reader Gets Mastered” section in greater detail.

**3) Back to basics**: I review fundamental techniques as they apply to the last “A Reader Gets Mastered” section.

**4) Big Picture**: I zoom out, and focus on something related to the last “A Reader Gets Mastered” section that is important to keep in the front of your mind.

###What if I am totally, *totally* new to this stuff?

This blog is aimed at musicians of any experience level. The material is explained in a way that is simple to understand, yet still covers the full breadth of the topic, including dips into the worlds of music theory, writing, acoustics, psychoacoustics, math (*dear god no!*), and signal processing, among other bordering fields.  

To get into the recurring four part rotation explained above, however, it is super duper helpful to have some basic foundational knowledge of digital audio recording and production. If words like:

- Mastering
- Equalization, or
- Dithering

sound foreign to you, you should check out the Get Started mini-series. This is where I explain a lot of that pesky jargo I mentioned before, in a way that is very easy to understand.

The last section of this mini-series also includes the software you will need to do your own mastering, including free alternatives, so if you don’t already have your own setup, make sure you don’t miss out on that!

In due time, I will be developing more mini-series, especially concerning recording and mixing. [Sign up for the mailing list](/#mailing_list) if you wanna get in on those.

###What if I want to tell you that you're wrong, or dumb or something?

Get Mastered is meant to be collaborative, so I use [Soundcloud](www.soundcloud.com/) to host all my featured tracks from week to week. I use the comment feature to point out specific sections of a song, and I encourage you to do the same. 

I also have comment sections at the bottom of all my posts. Get Mastered is meant to be a collaborative learning environment; it doesn’t work unless you make your thoughts known, boost good comments, and, of course... *ask questions!*

###What if I don't have time to learn all this stuff? I came here to get mastered *now*!

Woah, calm down there persistently questioning subsection header! In addition to your questions, I want to hear your music: you could be featured in the **A Reader Gets Mastered** section and walk away with a free master from me! 

[Find out more about submissions here.](/#submissions)

If you like the quality of the mastered tracks you hear on this blog, I also offer my own services at an *extremely* competitive price.

###Why do you do this anyway? What's in it for you, audio-boy?

I do all of this because it’s what I love to do. I maintain the website, I master the music, I write the posts; it’s all a one-man production, and it’s a lot of hard work. 

If you like what I’m doing, show your appreciation by being a part of the community, telling your friends, and...  *asking questions!*

###Okay, I'm ready. What do I click?
