So you've finished your mix, and everything sounds great. But when you listen to your final bounce next to commercial tracks, it just doesn't sound quite right. Something is off, and it's hard to put a finger on what. No matter how much you tweak, you just can't get your tracks to sound like those produced by artists you love.

*I've been here!* I've mixed music for years, and I know the feeling. Luckily, there's an easy way to solve this problem:

####Ask Someone To Help!

Mastering, at the most basic, basic level, is simply asking another engineer to help you make your sound better. And there's no shame in getting help! Even the best mixing engineers in the world get their music mastered, because they know that another pair of ears *always* helps.

The word **mastering** means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but to me, mastering means helping you make your track sound better. Despite this extremely general definition of the job, there are a few concrete steps I will typically go through to get this done:

##1) I Ask You What You Want

As I mentioned, many people often have different definitions of what mastering means to them, and if there is anything specific a client wants done, I like to have it in the front of my mind.

During this step, I also like to get an idea of what my client wants their song to sound like. This may be a list of influences, or musical descriptors, but it really helps me get an idea of how to move forward and what to listen for.

##2) I Give It a Listen

Perhaps obviously, before I start mastering your track, I'll give it a critical listen, all the way through. This allows me to understand the message of the song, the feel of the song, and which instruments in the mix were felt to be most important by the mix engineer.

During this step, I can also identify mix-level issues, and give you tips on how to make your mix better, before I even get to mastering.

##3) I Sculpt Tone Appropriately

Finally, time to get my hands dirty! (my mouse dirty?) 

Often, a mix won't come to me sounding perfect! I'll do some genre-specific processing, including processing with EQ, multi-band compressors, exciters, stereo imagers, and sometimes even reverb! The key here is that I only tweak what is appropriate and needed for the song. 

**I don't under-do it, and I certainly don't over-do it**. Often mastering is a collection of subtle tweaks that leads to a big change in tone. 

##4) I Make It Louder

Okay, okay!

When a lot of people think of mastering, the one thing they have in mind is making their track louder. Often mixes come out sounding too quiet, especially when compared to commercial releases.

The last thing I do when mastering a track is to make it louder in a genre specific way (that is to say, I won't make your folk song sound like an EDM track, or vice versa). I use high quality limiters and an experienced ear (and maybe even other secret tricks) to make this as absolutely transparent as possible.

So there you have it! If you decide to [get mastered by me](/mastering-services), this is what you're paying for (or not paying for if you want to get [get mastered for free!](/free-master)) As I've said ad nauseam, mastering means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and I will work with you to make sure I adhere to the definition you have in mind.
