So, you're ready to Get Mastered! The following are steps you should make sure to make before you send me your mix:

**1) Turn off any limiters or other plugins on the output bus**

**2) Turn down the master fader -6dB**

**3) Bounce in a high quality, lossless format**

**4) Turn off any normalization or dithering while bouncing**

More details on each of these steps can be found below:

###1) Turn off any limiters or other plugins on the output bus

I cannot stress the importance of this first step! If you have inserted any plugins on the output bus (also known as the master track) of your mix, please, *please* bypass them before you bounce the mix for mastering. A lot of the tricks I use to beef of the sonic quality of your mix rely on a certain level of dynamic range; if the mix is already limited, I can't do much to remove that on my end, and I won't be able to bring your song to its full potential.

Here is an example of a song that will be very difficult for me to improve, because it has been heavily limited, and has little to no dynamic range (that is, there are not many ups and downs in the audio):

In this specific example, the limiter actually added tons of distortion to the track that I could not remove! Bad bad bad!!!

Now, here is an example of what your track *should* look like after turning off any output limiters:

Beautiful, beautiful dynamics.

It is important to also turn off other plugins on the output bus, such as compressors, for me to do the best job possible. "But Keenan," you might shout, "the mix just isn't the same without them!" If you are staunchly opposed to bypassing some output plugins, let's compromise: send me one bounce with output plugins enabled, and one with them disabled.

###2) Turn down the master fader at least -6dB

The reasoning for this step is similar to step 1: I need to have a little extra space on top to do what I need to do. Please do me a favor and leave me 6dB of headroom by turning your master fader down -6dB before bouncing your mix.

###3) Bounce or export your mix in a high quality, lossless format

Your mix should be bounced in the same format in which it was recorded (generally, 24 bits with a sample rate of no less than 44.1kHz). If you recorded at a lesser quality, don't sweat it. 

File formats should be lossless (that is to say, *not* mp3s!!!). Lossless file formats include .wav, .aiff, and .flac.

###4) Turn of any normalization or dithering when bouncing your mix

Normalization will boost the volume of the track, destroying all those 6dB's of headroom! Dithering is not necessary if you are sending me a high quality, lossless mix, as you should be.
