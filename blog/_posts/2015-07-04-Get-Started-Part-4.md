###What is Mastering?

Finally, we have recorded and mixed an entire song! Now we can move on to the final part of producing a song: mastering.

Mastering involves adjusting the entire track to fit commercial standards in terms of loudness and digital format. It would be a shame, for instance, if your songs weren't featured on a radio station because they are at an inconsistent volume when compared to typical commercial releases.

Mastering is also sometimes thought of as simply making a mix "better." This can involve altering the tone of a track, adding a sense of cohesion to the track, or accentuating certain instruments over others. This is the trickiest part of mastering; how do we alter certain aspects of a song without access to the individual tracks?

In this final section of Get Started, we will start with the more technical aspects of mastering, specifically increasing loudness and changing a song's digital format. Then we will discuss ways through which we might be able to make a mix just sound "better".

This section of Get Started will also heavily rely on information we learned in parts one through three of the series, so make sure you know your vocab (you can always quickly run back and check words you forgot about!)

####Loudness

The most tell-tale sign that a song hasn't been mastered is when that song simply doesn't sound as loud as other songs when played at the same volume.

You might think, "Well, that's easy to fix: just turn up the output level of the track!" Unfortunately, it's not quite that easy. We can only increase the volume of a track so much before we start clipping on our output. So how else can we make things sound louder if we can't increase volume? To be able to fix this problem, we need to think about what defines loudness.

Remember from Part 1 of this series, when we discussed loudness in terms of *our brain's translation* of the strength of air molecules vibrating in the air? It turns out that our brain has a funny way of interpreting these vibrations that has to do with the average volume and the peak volume of a sound.

Imagine a normal snare drum hit: there is a loud attack and a short low level resonance that dies pretty quickly. 

Now, if we compress that snare drum, we are increasing the average volume of the entire sound. We can go even more extreme and limit the snare using a limiter (a compressor with an infinite ratio). This is essentially how mastering engineers make tracks sound louder: very careful limiting.

When we limit an entire track, we are basically squeezing the loudest sounds down in volume, and raising the level of the whole track, effectively increasing the lower levels in the mix (and therefore the average volume of the track). Essentially, we are trying to lessen the gap between our loudest sounds and quietest sounds.

This gap is called a track's **dynamic range**. Usually it is helpful for a mastering engineer to work with a track with a lot of dynamic range; other wise there is nothing left to limit!

###A Final Note: Should I Master My Own Music?

Of course you *can* master your own music. But should you?

A lot of people say no. A large added bonus of the mastering process is a second pair of ears on your mix, in particular a set of *really* experienced ears.

Unfortunately though, mastering is often expensive. It is oft said of mastering that "you get what you pay for," and experienced mix engineers know not to skimp on a budget mastering job. However, though it may be all well and good to get a second pair of ears on a mix, sometimes it is just financially unaffordable. 

On the flip side, if you have a debut EP, you don't want that to be your first master ever - you will most likely end up compromising all of the hard work you put into writing, recording, and mixing the songs!

Here at Get Mastered, we have our own special version of the typical mastering process that focusses on collaboration with artists and engineers. If you would like to learn more about our mastering, [read our post here](/blog/about/What-Is-Mastering/)
