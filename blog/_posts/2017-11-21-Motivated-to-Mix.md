The more and more I mix, the more I realize that the more I mix the more mixes I am proud of!

I know I know—sorry. Too much alliteration for one intro. But it's true. **Mixing more projects at once and putting yourself on a schedule will drastically increase the quality of your mixes**, as long as you do it right.

# Give yourself too much work

I find a *huge* benefit to throwing away the traditional idea of a deadline for music. Musical inspiration—whether you are producing beats or writing a folk guitar part—comes in waves, depending on your mood, the time of day, and what you had for breakfast. The music that we write and mix naturally stems from the context of your life, and forcing a musical work to completion before you are naturally inspired to produce more usually results in a song you are not proud of.

Instead, I find that having many projects going on at once greatly stimulates my inspiration. Maybe I can't focus enough to finish writing that cinematic strings part today, but hey, I would love to mix that other song I am writing! Giving yourself a multitude of different songs to work on—including mixing songs that you didn't have a hand in writing—maximizes the time that you spend writing music. And since no one song has a set deadline, you are free to table things when they are not working out.

# Set a schedule

Even though you should abandon the traditional idea of a deadline for individual works, *you should still set overall deadlines and timeframes for more abstract goals.* Set a goal for yourself that doesn't depend on any individual song coming to completion, such as writing an album in a year, or releasing one polished, mastered song a month. Goals like this—that *don't* depend on specific songs—will greatly increase the efficiency of your daily and weekly writing, because you will focus on what matters, and what is closest to being finished. Setting a timeline like this also keeps old projects from getting *too* old. 

# Quit more often

But what about that one song with that you can't quite finish? The one with a great hook that you can't seem to write a melody for? Counterintuitively, often the best thing you can do for these kinds of songs is put them of the backburner. Indefinitely. In other words: quit! Focus your time on another song that you know you can finish, or a task you know you are feeling ready to do. One day, you might open up that old, cobwebbed folder and find that you know how to finish it at long last. Above all else, *prioritize what you know you can finish, and put everything else away for a little bit.*


# Keeping Context

Not only will this method get you completing more projects, moving from work to work daily or weekly will really help smooth away the biases you develop listening to one song over and over. If you have been mixing the same track, or hearing the same melody, over and over, the obvious points of concern for the track become worn down, and you will start to focus on elements that really, really don't matter. As someone who has recorded hundreds of vocal tracks before realizing that, maybe, this is an instrumental track, you can take it from me!

# Recap

Here is a quick recap of this writing method

* Keep your overall goals (e.g. mix one song per month, etc) *front and center.* If you can meet that goal today, prioritize it.
* Start building a backlog of unfinished songs
* if you can't add to an old project, start a new project
* keep your creativity on its toes by jumping from song to song and not focusing too hard on one mix

And if you need that extra kick of motivation to make yourself finish at least one song a month, [we have just the plan for that.](/#mastering) Having a mastering engineer reviewing your work every month, and committing to completing one song your are proud of a month, will really kick your productivity and abilities into overdrive!
