**Why is the girl in this stock photo making this face?**

Is it because she's psyched about her monochromatic outfit? Probably not. 

Is it because she just got asked to prom by the cutest boy in school? Guess again.

Is it because she just got paid $30 to wear headphones in a stock photo shoot? Maybe, but for the sake of wrapping up this careening introduction, no. 

It's because she's listening to your newest mix, and she's really *really* into it. Take another look:

<p class="blog-img-caption"> "Straight fire" she whispers before fainting on the spot</p>

But why does she love your mix so much? Is it your new preamps, or the thirty-plus hours you spent penciling in de-breath-ing automation on all of your harmony vocal tracks? No way - she doesn't care about any of that.

She cares about **how the mix sounds, to her**. Not how the mix sounds to someone who has heard the underlying song countless times, and who has been through the entire recording and writing process. If this girl thought your mix was a little too high-end heavy, you'd be unwise to discard her opinions as uninformed, regardless of whether or not you agree (especially, in this case, since she is probably younger than you, and can [hear more high end than you](http://tonal.goodhertz.co/hearing-loss/)).

### Get more, and better, ears on your work

What matters to me more than anything in terms of personal improvement is **getting feedback on my work**. At the end of the day, you want your mix to sound unequivocally great to anyone who listens - so it makes sense to get as many ears on your mix as possible. This may seem obvious, but truly take a second to think about how often you ask for feedback - even I don't think that I ever can receive enough!

Of course, however, quality trumps quantity. The best thing your mixing skills can benefit from, more-so than any amount of room treatment, high quality DAC's, or expensive microphones, is an **engaging, reliable group of friends with whom you can regularly and mutually grow your skills**.

Finding people as passionate as you are about mixing is an extremely rewarding experience, and you'll find that you start thinking completely differently while mixing. Nowadays when I mix, I will sit down in front of my DAW, take a deep breath, and press play from the beginning, pretending like I have a peer in the room. Even when I don't have people directly critiquing me, knowing that they will hear my mix later in the week during a weekly critiquing session makes me think *completely* differently, as though they are in the room next to me. I start focusing on bigger issues, like overall levels, and suddenly smaller things, like all that de-breath-ing, don't matter at all (maybe those harmony vocals were too loud anyway!)

I find that my mixing skills grow much more rapidly when I can rely on people to critically evaluate my work, and listen with different ears than mine, because I always bring myself back to the bigger issues at hand. It's only when I go too far down the rabbit hole that I'm dissatisfied with my mixes - I often find a simple solution myself or am offered one by a peer when mixing this way.

*Start a listening group today* with some peers - don't put it off! Pretty soon you'll see your mixes improve drastically, and you'll be able to focus on the bigger issues at hand. And you'll be able to impress this woman.

As our inaugural blog post, this has been quite the adventure for me. I would love to hear anyone's experience mixing with friends in the comments!
