My name is Keenan, and for all of my life I have had a passion for really, really great sounding music. I grew up recording music and have never looked back, receiving a degree in Electrical Engineering and Music Recording. I'm of course also an active musician, singing and playing guitar in a band, and dabbling in whatever else I can get my hands on.

Having self-produced my own music for many years, I know how difficult it can be to perform, record, mix, and master a song that you are completely proud of. In my experience, there was always that special "extra something" missing, and I was quick to realize an easy way to fix this issue: get someone to help!

Unfortunately, typical mastering services were expensive for my budget, and all the cheaper services or automated softwares I could find were not cutting it (I know how to use a limiter is too, thanks). Even more than that though, I wanted someone who knew what they were doing to listen to my music and not only give my track a professional sound, but give me feedback on what I could be doing better.

I believe the mastering process to be not only an important final step for gluing a track together and adding volume, but to be an important (and oft missed) opportunity to receive mixing feedback and grow as a producer.

#### That is why I created Get Mastered, as a way for independent musicians and recording hobbyists to foster a direct relationship with an experienced audio engineer, and make great sounding music, together.

As part of our whole vibe, **Get Mastered offers mastering services at rates that artists can actually afford.** After extensive data collection, I have set my rates to sit around what musicians consider a fair price, and offer different packages for different budgets. In addition to this, Get Mastered is the *only* place where you can test the waters, and get an [absolutely, no joke, 100% free master](/) without any commitment. That's how confident I am you'll love working with us.

We also offer services for anything else audio related. Whether it be for your podcast, movie, or voiceover, anytime you want to make your audio better, we are here to help. **For inquiries on other audio services, shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:services@getmastered.com?Subject=Other%20audio%20services" target="_top">services@getmastered.com</a>**.
