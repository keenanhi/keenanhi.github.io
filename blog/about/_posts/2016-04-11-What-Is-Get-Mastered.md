[My name is Keenan](/blog/about/Who-We-Are/), and for all of my life I have had a passion for really, really great sounding audio. I grew up recording my own original music and have never looked back, receiving a degree in Electrical Engineering and Music Recording. I've had experience researching human perception of audio quality, creating automated room equalization algorithms, and engineering directional hearing devices to aid people with hearing loss. I'm of course also an active musician, singing and playing guitar in a band, and learning whatever else I can get my hands on.

Having self-produced my own music for many years, I know how difficult it can be to perform, record, mix, and master something that you are completely proud of. In my experience, there was always that special "extra something" missing. Before long I realized an easy way to make my audio better: get someone with more experience to help!

I had heard of mastering being the stage where this "extra something" is added by professionals. Unfortunately, typical mastering services were completely beyond my budget, while any cheaper services or automated softwares I could find were not cutting it. Even more than that though, I wanted someone who knew what they were doing to listen to my music and not only give my track a professional sound, but give me feedback on what I could be doing better. And I couldn't find that outside of my college classrooms.

**That is why I created Get Mastered: as a way for independent musicians, recording hobbyists, and podcasters to foster a direct relationship with an experienced audio engineer, and not only make great sounding audio, but learn how to become better producers themselves.**

Despite our extensive experience with audio, we are just launching as a business, so please let us know if you see anything you think we can improve. Whether technological, or concerning any part of our service, please send all feedback, questions, or concerns to <a href="mailto:services@getmastered.com?Subject=Feedback" target="_top">services@getmastered.com</a>.

## Here's to making great audio, together!
