Music mastering means different things to different people. Of course, there are some technical aspects of mastering that most agree upon - but to us at Get Mastered, there are a few hugely important parts of the mastering process that are lost with cheap mastering services and auto-"mastering" softwares.

Mastering is, in essence, the process of transforming a mix which has been bounced or exported as one stereo audio file into a finalized, ready to release song.

A well mastered song will sound

* cohesive,
* professional,
* warm,
* great in any format,
* great through any sound system,
* great in any space,
* and loud,

while still retaining the overall style, vision, and dynamics of the original mix. This requires a vast amount of technical know-how as well as objective, experienced ears.

Our mastering process at Get Mastered includes 6 important steps:

### Step 1 - Getting to know YOU

In music, everyone has their own style and tastes. Most mastering services don't take this into account, but our engineers at Get Mastered truly work hard to understand you as a musician or producer.

During this stage, we ask you to send us music you consider beautifully produced, so that we can get an idea of what you are working towards. We also ask you to send us some of your previous musical works, so we can get a sense of your own style - which is something we *never* want to compromise!

### Step 2 - Feedback

In any profession, feedback is extremely important, and music production is no different. Independent music production is rapidly growing, and with it a loss of feedback loops between multiple engineers working together.

For our next step, you send us your best mix, and we work with you to bring it to your quality standards, if it is not there already. This is a vital step to mastering that is completely lost with cheap services and auto-"mastering" software. There are some things that are *truly* impossible to fix in the mastering stage without compromising other areas of the mix, and it is extremely important we iron out any mix-level issues before mastering.

Through this step, our clients are also able to improve their own mixing skills, and learn straight from the experts!

### Step 3 - Cohesion

Next, our engineers take the reigns.

Often times, before mastering, a song can sound more like a "mix" than a "song". During this stage of the mastering process, we perform extremely precise, high quality analog-emulated processing to gel the mix together without sacrificing its overall sound. We don't just slap on a preset with a mastering suite plug-in - every mix we work on has different needs, and we treat each song only with the processing it needs.

This stage is **where the magic happens**, so to speak - afterwards, your song will sound crisp, warm, and cohesive.

### Step 4 - Translation

The next step is making sure your music sound great everywhere, or making it **translate** well to different  environments. Sure, your mix sounds good in the studio - but how does it sound in a car? Over the radio? As an MP3? On Spotify? On vinyl? On headphones? On cheap laptop speakers?

This is a vital stage of mastering that is - again - completely lost with cheap services and auto-"mastering" software... noticing a theme here?

### Step 5 - Loudness!

Finally, after your song is sounding amazing, we make it **loud** without sacrificing dynamics.

We don't just slap a limiter on the output and call it a day - it is actually extremely difficult to increase the apparent volume of a song without sacrificing dynamics, warmth, and low-end punchiness, and there is a lot of nuance involved in this stage of our mastering. The track you receive from us will ultimately be as loud as you would like us to make it!

### Step 6 - Review

Once all of our engineers sign off on how the master sounds, we send it back to you for review. We tweak everything to your liking, to make sure you are getting the sound your music deserves. Our work is done only when you are completely and fully satisfied with how your music sounds! We care about our clients, and don't want you leaving with anything until it blows you away.

At Get Mastered, our mission is simple: give you the best sounding music possible. We know how to do it, and we can't wait to show you. [Try us out today, and see how your music can sound when you Get Mastered!](/#pricing)
