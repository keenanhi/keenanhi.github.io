~~starting~~ 

This isn't a music theory course - it's theory application in writing and mixing

Play with better people

1, 2, 3, 4... Listen!!!

Learn the basics, touch a piano and listen

homework - learn by playing with songs you like and figuring out the chords on your instrument of choice. Or just listen and figure out the chords on the fly!

~~~advanced~~~

less is more - don't always play the whole chord!

modulations

breaking the rules the normal ways - major two, minor four, major three

breaking the rules even more - dissonance, out of tune, adding notes from the scale (or not from the scale!)
