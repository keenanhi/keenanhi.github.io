            My name is Keenan, and I created Get Mastered as a way for independent musicians to foster a direct relationship with an experienced audio engineer at a realistic rate.

            When it comes to mixing and mastering, a lot of producers like to say, "you get what you pay for."  I like to think of Get Mastered as the exception that makes the rule.

  <h1>How does Get Mastered provide such low rates?</h1>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">
  My name is Keenan, and I founded Get Mastered because there is simply nowhere for musicians to get a professional, quality mastering job for under $100 per song. I've been mixing music for years, and I've found it impossible to get mastered professionaly at anything close to an affordable rate. 

<br>
<br>
  <b>
  With Get Mastered, you are not paying less for a "cheaper" mastering job; you're paying a price that's actually fair.
</b>

  <br>
  <br>

  Get Mastered recruits extremely talented up and coming engineers that understand what fair pricing means for independent musicians, and are eager to work for fair wages doing what they love: helping you.
