            Do your mixes need that "<b>extra something</b>"?

            <br>
            <br>

            Do you want your mixes <b>loud </b>enough to compete with commercial standards?

            <br>
            <br>

            Do you want the <b>absolute best price</b> for a professional mastering job, with a human (not an algorithm!) at the reins?

            <br>
            <br>

            You've come to the right place.

             Since I'm based online, I don't have the overhead associated with typical mastering studios, which means I can give you professional quality masters at <i>extremely</i> competitive rates that you really won't find anywhere else (I did the research, and you can too)
<br>
<br>

      	If that's not enough: <b>for every five songs I master for you, I'll master a sixth for free</b>. 
            <br>
