            <b>You've come to the right place.</b>

            <br>
            <br>

            Get Mastered is home of the <b>absolute best rates</b> for a professional, release-ready master. I did the research, and I encourage you to do the same!

             <!-- Since I'm based online, I don't have the overhead associated with typical mastering studios, which means I can give you professional quality masters at <i>extremely</i> competitive rates that you really won't find anywhere else (I did the research, and you can too). -->

<!-- </p> -->
<!-- <h2>
            And right now, you can <a href="/free-master">Get mastered for free</a> before you even pay a dime!
</h2> -->

<!-- <p> -->

<br>
<br>

        But before you pay <i>a single dime</i>, it is my policy to master a song completely for free for every new potential client. I want to prove to you how much of a difference it makes to Get Mastered; that's why I <a href="/free-master">will master your song, for free</a>, with <i>absolutely no commitment</i> on your part.

        <br>
        <br>

        I also have a 100% satisfaction policy; I won't stop working on your masters until they are as crisp, punchy, and LOUD as you want them! On top of all this, I offer free mixing advice, as well as free mastering preparation advice to my clients.

        <br>
<br>
      	Without further adieu, my rates are:
            <br>
