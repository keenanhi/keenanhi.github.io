<br>

            My name is Keenan, and I created Get Mastered as a way for independent musicians to foster a direct, personal relationship with an experienced audio engineer to make great music, together.

            When it comes to mastering, a lot of producers like to say, "you get what you pay for."  I like to think of Get Mastered as the exception that makes the rule.</b>

            <i>"Keenan was amazing, he worked with me throughout the process and even helped advise me on subtle ways to make my record better. He cared not just about his work process but what I did as well, and that's what makes the best records – people working together. If you want a mastering engineer to help take your recordings to the next level, Keenan's your guy."</i>
