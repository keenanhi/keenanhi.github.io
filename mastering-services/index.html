      	Learning how to master your own music takes a lot of time. Sometimes, my readers just want great sounding, ready for release music without the hassle of learning all the nitty-gritty details.

      	<br>
      	<br>

      	If you want to join the crowd and bring your music to a professional level, this if your chance! Since I'm based online, I don't have the overhead associated with typical mastering studios, which means I'm able to offer you <i>extremely</i> competitive rates that you really won't find anywhere else.
<br>
<br>

      	If that's not enough, I'll even throw you a deal: <b>for every five songs I master for you, I'll master a sixth for free</b>. 
      	That's a six song EP for the price of a five song EP, or a twelve song album for the price of a ten song album (I just checked with a calculator, those numbers are right)
<br>
<br>
      	Interested? Email me at <a href="mailto:services@getmastered.com">services@getmastered.com</a> and let me know what I can help you with! My rates are:

		I have a <b>guarunteed turnaround time of one week or less</b>, and I can even help you get your songs on popular music services, such as Spotify, iTunes, and Google Play. Again, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:services@getmastered.com">services@getmastered.com</a> to Get Mastered!
