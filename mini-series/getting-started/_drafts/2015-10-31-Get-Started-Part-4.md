###What is Mastering?

Finally, we have recorded and mixed an entire song! Now we can move on to the final part of producing a song: mastering.

Mastering involves adjusting the entire track to fit commercial standards in terms of loudness and digital format. It would be a shame, for instance, if your songs weren't featured on a radio station because they are at an inconsistent volume when compared to typical commercial releases.

Mastering is also sometimes thought of as simply making a mix "better." This can involve altering the tone of a track, adding a sense of cohesion to the track, or accentuating certain instruments over others. This is the trickiest part of mastering; how do we alter certain aspects of a song without access to the individual tracks?

In this final section of Get Started, we will start with the more technical aspects of mastering, specifically increasing loudness and changing a song's digital format. Then we will discuss ways through which we might be able to make a mix just sound "better".

This section of Get Mastered will also heavilly rely on information we learned in parts one through three of the series, so make sure you know your vocab (you can always quickly run back and check words you forgot about!)

###Technical Details

####Loudness

The most tell-tale sign that a song hasn't been mastered is when that song simply doesn't sound as loud as other songs when played at the same volume.

You might think, "Well, that's easy to fix: just turn up the output level of the track!" Unfortunately, it's not quite that easy. We can only increase the volume of a track so much before we start clipping on our output. So how else can we make things sound louder if we can't increase volume? To be able to fix this problem, we need to think about what defines loudness.

Remember from Part 1 of this series, when we discussed loudness in terms of *our brain's translation* of the strength of air molecules vibrating in the air? It turns out that our brain has a funny way of interpretting these vibrations that has to do with the average volume and the peak volume of a sound.

Imagine a normal snare drum hit: there is a loud attack and a short low level resonance that dies pretty quickly. Here is some audio of just that:

SNARE AUDIO

Now, if we compress that snare drum, we are increasing the average volume of the entire sound. We can go even more extreme and limit the snare using a limiter (a compressor with an infinite ratio). Here's the same snare sound run through a limiter.

LIMITED SNARE SOUND

Notice how the second sample sounds much louder than the first! This is essentially how mastering engineers make tracks sound louder: very careful limiting.

When we limit an entire track, we are basically squeezing the loudest sounds down in volume, and raising the level of the whole track, effectively increasing the lower levels in the mix (and therefore the average volume of the track). Essentially, we are trying to lessen the gap between our loudest sounds and quietest sounds.

This gap is called a track's **dynamic range** or more colloquially, **headroom**. Usually it is helpful for a mastering engineer to work with a track with a lot of headroom; other wise there is nothing left to limit!


####Digital Formatting

One of the worst ways to screw up a great song is to neglect to put it in the right format.



###A Final Note: Should I Master My Own Music?

Of course you *can* master your own music. But should you?

A lot of people say no. A large added bonus of the mastering process is a second pair of ears on your mix, in particular a set of *really* experienced ears.

Unfortunately though, mastering is often expensive. Though it may be all well and good to get a second pair of ears on a mix, sometimes it is just financially unaffordable. 

My view is this: I made this blog for people to *learn* how to master their own music. I am a strong, strong believer that anyone can learn any skill if they want it enough, and if they have enough time and patience to gain the experience necessary to do a great job mastering.

On the flip side, if you have a debut EP, you don't want that to be your first master ever - you will most likely end up compromising all of the hard work you put into writing, recording, and mixing the songs!

I put all of the songs on this blog for download so that you can try mastering them yourself. Try it, again and again and again, on *other people's music* until you really feel like you know what you are doing. I scan all the comment for user masters so I can give constructive criticism and help you learn - that's what this site is for!

For your own special releases that you want a professional mastering job on, I [offer my own services](/mastering-services) for a price that undercuts everyone I could find. 

You might think, "Of course you would recommend your own services!" But it really is the best way to go if you want the *best possible sound* right now. I'll even outline exactly what I did to improve your mix, so that you can learn, and maybe try the next one yourself!

Now you're finally ready to be let out of the gate. Start checking out some of the mastered posts on here, learning some cool techniques, and *trying them out yourself!!!*

Hope you learned a ton; now check out the first A Reader Gets Mastered post [here!]()
