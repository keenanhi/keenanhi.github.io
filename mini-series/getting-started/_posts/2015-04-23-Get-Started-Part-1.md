###What is Sound, Really Though?

Welcome to the Get Started mini-series!

In this series, we will review the foundations of the modern music production process. If you’re totally new to this stuff, this is the place for you, and even if you have experience, reviewing the basics never hurts!

The series will be split into three sections:

**Part 1: What is Sound, Really Though?** An overview of sound and it's basic characteristics (hint: you are reading this one)

**Part 2: What is Digital Audio?** How sound waves, electricity, and computers work together ([jump to Part 2](/mini-series/getting-started/Get-Started-Part-2/))

**Part 3: What is Mixing?** An overview of the modern recording process, including tools used in altering recorded music ([jump to Part 3](/mini-series/getting-started/Get-Started-Part-3/))

**Part 4: What is Mastering?** A bit on mix preparation, and your toolkit as a mastering engineer ([jump to Part 4](/mini-series/getting-started/Get-Started-Part-4/))

This series will also frequently reference the glossary I am actively cultivating. Don’t just skip over words that confuse you; learning this vocab now will save you headaches later. Plus, you will impress all your friends when you can point out the sidechain compression on the kick in that EDM song at that party (if they can hear you over the bass, that is)

So let’s Get Started by answering the question:

###What is sound?

The definition of sound is a little more complicated than it would seem! Sound is our perception of a material's variation of pressure  versus time through our ears, and the auditory processing parts of our brain. Typically, this material will be air, though - and I hope I don’t sound crazy - we can perceive variations in pressure of other materials too, like water! Just fill up your tub, stick your head underwater, and listen for your roommates to ask you what on earth you are doing. You will be able to hear them, though maybe not as clearly. For now, however, we are just going to deal with air, since most of us aren’t listening to music underwater ([most of us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeChHVAbVhI)).

To better understand what this definition means, we need to dip our toes (just our toes!) into physics (only for a second!). Remember: **DON'T PANIC.** Physics is more afraid of you than you are of it.

Pressure is a distribution of force across a given area. In terms of sound, the **force** comes from air molecules bouncing against the **area** of your eardrum. The more air molecules you have shoved into one space (i.e. the higher the density of air molecules), the more force they can exert against your eardrum. Conversely, the less air molecules you have shoved into one space (i.e. the lower the density of air molecules), the less force they can exert against your eardrum. It is this variation in air molecule density, that leads to a variation in **pressure** against our eardrum that we hear as sound.

Below is a great animation with which we can visualize the change in density of air molecules that leads to our hearing of sound. Notice how if you pick one position in the sqaure, there is a constantly changing density of air molecules, as the higher pressure "ripples" of air seem to move through that point.

<img class="hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md" src="http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/rad2/latquad.gif" alt="pressure wave gif" width="30%">

In fact, a very useful way of thinking about these "ripples" of higher density air molecules is to call them waves. Specifically, we call this a **sound wave**, and we can think about it just like a wave created by dropping a rock into a pond.

It is a little bit easier to think of these variations in pressure as vibration. Think of when you play music too loudly in your car and the whole thing starts vibrating; that vibration is the direct affect of sound.

An easy way to differentiate sound waves from one another is to measure the distance between the points of highest pressure, or the points of highest air molecule density. This is pretty easy to see: All the "darker" circles are high pressure points. Since we are taling about sound waves, we call this distance the **wavelength**, the length of the wave. Every wavelength, the wave repeats itself. A wavelength is a distance per cycle of the wave.

Now something that is going to [blow your mind](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-28553-Steve-Jobs-mind-blown-gif-HD-T-pVbd.gif): Keep your eyes focused on one individual air molecule in the animation above (one individual dot). Notice that it is vibrating back and forth at a constant rate (if you are having trouble seeing it, it's a little easier to see towards the center of the image). Now pick any other dot, and notice that it too is vibrating back and forth *at the exact same rate*. Pull out a stopwatch if you don't believe me. Call my bluff, I dare you.

This vibration is called a sound's **frequency**. Air can vibrate quickly, and air can vibrate slowly.  When air vibrates quickly, it has a high frequency, and when it vibrates slowly, it has a low frequency. 

The unit of frequency is **Hertz** (abbreviated Hz), which simply means cycles per second. If you did pull out your stopwatch, and noticed that each dot was returning to the same position once every second, it would have a frequency of 1 Hz (one cycle per second). If a sound is oscillating at 100 Hz, that means that air molecules are moving back and forth 100 times every second.

If air vibrates at a frequency anywhere between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz, we can hear it as sound. Outside of that range, the air is still moving; we just can't hear it! Other animals can hear different ranges of frequencies that we cannot ([dogs, for instance, can hear frequencies above 20,000 Hz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk0HsvQ7m_E))

Remember, a wavelength is a distance per cycle, and a frequency is a cycle per second. If a sound wave goes 2 meters per cycle (has a wavelength of 2 meters) and cycles once every one second (has a frequency of 1 Hz), it is moving 2 meters every second. Thus, sound waves also have a speed, or **velocity** that is a direct relationship between wavelength and frequency. Mathematically, velocity, wavelength, and frequency are related by the equation:


Which should seem pretty intuitive if you've followed along thus far.

### Fundamental Frequency, Harmonics, and Pitch

In nearly all real life scenarios, sound will not consist of one frequency, but of many, many different frequencies layered upon each other. The lowest of these frequencies is called the **fundamental frequency** of a sound. Every other frequency within the sound is called a **harmonic**.

Our brains translate these fundamental frequencies into something we call **pitch**. When you hit a middle C on a piano, you hear a pitch corresponding to that key's fundamental frequency, which is, in this case, 261.6 Hz. This is the lowest frequency in the sound you hear when you hear a middle C on a piano, *but* there are still harmonics above this, which are translated by your brain as **timbre**, or the characteristic of the sound. If you listened to a trumpet playing concert middle C, you are still hearing the fundamental frequency of 261.6 Hz as its pitch, but the trumpet's harmonics, and thus its timbre, are significantly different from that of a piano.

So remember: pitch is your brain's translation of fundamental frequency, and timbre is your brain's translation of harmonics [^notreally]

##### An Example: The synthesizer

Perhaps the easiest instrument on which to visualize fundamental frequencies versus harmonic frequencies is the synthesizer. Most synthesizers start by sending out very basic tones that can then be altered with all of those knobs, buttons, and sliders. These basic tones are usually include easy to recognize shapes, such as sine waves, square waves, triangle waves, and sawtooth waves, represented below (in that order):

<!--![synth waves](http://cdn.instructables.com/FU2/E0V7/H0URBWVS/FU2E0V7H0URBWVS.LARGE.jpg)-->

<img class="hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md" src="http://cdn.instructables.com/FU2/E0V7/H0URBWVS/FU2E0V7H0URBWVS.LARGE.jpg" alt="synth waves" width="40%">

It's easy to see where these names come from!

Something you might notice is that, though these waves have different shapes, they have the same fundamental frequency; they each repeat 3 times in this picture (if this picture's length represented 1 second, they would be oscillating at 3 Hz). So, saying the same thing a different way, these all have the same pitch.

The difference in the shapes of these waves represents the different timbres you hear listening to these sounds. Just like we talked about with the piano and trumpet, these all have the same fundamental frequencies, but different harmonics.

A sine wave has *no* additional harmonics. If we play a sine wave at 261 Hz (just about middle C), we hear this:

SINE WAVE TONE

A square wave consists of a sine wave at its fundamental frequency, plus sine waves at odd-order harmonics. In other words, the fundamental (261 Hz), the fundamental times 3 (783 Hz), the fundamental times 5 (1305 Hz), the fundamental times 7 (1827 Hz), all the way through infinity. That sounds like:

SQUARE WAVE TONE

Similarly, triangle and sawtooth waves consist of similar series of adding together different harmonic patterns of sine waves. In fact, *every* sound *ever heard* in the history of *forever* consists of different combinations of sine waves, added together. In these simple cases, there are patterns we can follow, but for more complex sounds like that of a piano and trumpet, the sequence of harmonics fall out of any pattern and become much more complex, and thus are very difficult to recreate synthetically. That is why if you set a synthesizer to a piano or trumpet setting, you will usually get something that sounds similar to a piano or trumpet, but is easily distinguishable from the original sound.

### Tone

Things start to get tricky, from a vocabulary perspective, when we try to separate timbre and **tone**. The definitions I am giving are by no means universally agreed upon, but will suffice for the sake of music production.

Whereas timbre is the typical collection of harmonics allowing you to distinguish different instruments, tone is a description of the *flavor* of that timbrel source. Think of different timbres as a specific kinds of food (e.g. french fries vs. pumpkin pie) and tone as certain flavorings of one type of food (salted french fries vs. unsalted french fries).

An electric guitar might be bright (lots of high frequency harmonics), distorted (lots of added unnatural harmonics), or warm (lots of pleasant sounding harmonics), for example, but it still has the timbre of an electric guitar. Brightness, distortion, and warmth are some examples of descriptors of tone; there are countless more that are often based more in musical slang than in science (e.g. muddy, clean, thick, crunchy, sparkly)


### Filters

Something cool us humans have figured out is that you can **filter** sounds. A filter is something that changes the strength of certain frequencies in a sound. Just as you might filter your coffee, you are, with a filter, removing parts of a sound, effectively "straining out" certain frequencies. If you think a grand piano has too much high-frequency harmonics, you can filter them out by closing the lid. When you stuck your head underwater earlier, the water was filtering out some of the higher harmonics of your roommates' voices.

What's more, air itself can act as a filter, if you get enough of it! If you have been to an outdoor concert, or seen a marching band, you'll notice that the further away you move from the sound source, the more air filters out high frequencies, while you can still hear lower frequency sounds like the bass guitar or bass drum at about the same volume.

In all of these cases, a physical object acts as a filter. Though all of these examples acted upon high frequency harmonics, filters can act on any range of frequencies. We tricky humans have figured out how to manipulate audio so that we can eliminate or accentuate certain frequencies in a much more exact way than by filtering sound through physical objects. When done electrically, filtering is called **equalization**, which we will come back to in Part 3 of Get Started.

### Loudness

When we filter a sound, we are changing the loudness of certain frequencies within that sound. So it makes sense to go back and ask the seemingly innocuous question: what is loudness?

**Loudness** is our brains translation of the strength of a sound, or, in other words, how hard the air molecules which make up a sound are vibrating[^notreally2]. Intuitively, the harder the air is a-shakin', the louder the sound is a-soundin', and conversly, the weaker the quieter. A sound's total loudness relates to the loudness of all of it's components: not just the fundamental frequency, and not just the harmonics.

### Recreating Sound

Of course,  you wouldn't be reading this now if recorded music didn't exist! So how to we make it sound like there is a rock band living inside of our computer speakers, ready to play any song at our will?

The trick lies in converting those wiggling air molecules into wiggling electrons. Just like music in the air consists of different frequencies of air molecule vibrations, music in your computer consists of different frequencies of electron vibrations.

[^notreally]: note I keep saying *brain's translation* here; your brain is not always exact. This is outside the scope of this series, but I will come back to it some day. Just like most things concerning psychoacoustics, it's pretty trippy, and just a little too confusing for now.
