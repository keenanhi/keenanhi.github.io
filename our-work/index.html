				"I had a great time working with Keenan from Get Mastered. He approached my music with an open-minded, collaborative attitude, offering constructive advice and expertise while still working to retain the spirit and vision of what I was trying to make. He's a talented engineer with a solid ear - I would recommend him to anyone!"

				“Keenan did an excellent job mastering my songs. He was responsive to my notes and, as we collaborated, was quick to turn around each new draft. I’d recommend his services to anyone looking to get their project professionally mastered.”

				"Get Mastered is a truly amazing team! My master was delivered quickly and it sounds top notch! I've been able to say how I wanted the song to sound like and the results were beyond my expectations. I didn't think they could make my music sound so professional. Moreover, it's a real pleasure to work with people who really care about their customers!"
